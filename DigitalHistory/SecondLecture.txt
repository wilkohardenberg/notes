THATCamp Florence 2011 – Finding & filtering primary sources

See the Google doc here, anyone can add comments!

This session discusses the various ways in which humanities scholars can locate primary sources on the internet. The goal of the session will be to collect ideas and search strategies and, ideally, to create a basic HOW TO guide.

We could also discuss differences between using physical and online primary sources and the caveats of using e-sources.

Questions:

    search strategies: is there a basic systematic way of finding online sources or does it depend on topics (or both)?
    types of online resources
    tools
    useful information: manuals, articles, etc.
    differences between using physical and online primary sources

Search strategies

‘Normal’ search engines:

    Google, etc.

Searching the deep web: OAI-MHP compliant search engines:

(Open Archives Initiative –  Metadata Harvesting Protocol)

    OAIster - Worldcat
    BASE – Bielefeld Academisch Search Engine. http://www.base-search.net

Custom search engines:

Create a search engine with websites that are relevant to your own research:

    European History Primary Sources CSE (but no deep web). http://primary-sources.eui.eu

Useful online resources

Indexes:

    Primary Documents Online – California State University San Marcos http://library.csusm.edu/subject_guides/history/online_primary.asp

Using e-sources

    querying e-sources:
    metadata determine what you can find
    keyword versus full-text search (think for example languages that cannot be OCR’ed yet).
    context; example Historical Jewish Press, see also this advanced search. Physical sources: from general to specific. Many digital sources (especially full text): start with specific. Where does awareness of context go?
    infinite archives/libraries: awareness of selection!
