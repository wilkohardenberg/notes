I've always considered my craft as a historian to tell stories.

Forgotten stories?
Most stories have been told already.

I tell stories to make an argument. Even the best crafted story, if it doesn't support an argument about how and why things happened, appears to me meaningless. Most stories are out there to be grasped, many have already been told in excruciating detail, and it doesn't take much effort to reframe them in a narrative: but what do these stories tell us in relation to the other stories around them? What is their role in explaining the spirit of time?  

Truth be told there are still some untold stories. But those as well do not add much to our understanding of the past if they are not used!
