SVGs fail in embedding and scaling images

If I try to open a SVG file created with Inkscape in another vector drawing software or a browser the overlaid images (embedded using the tool in --> Extensions) do not show up as if they referred still to xlinks. Moreover, the background image does not scale correctly in respect to the text. If I save the file instead as a PDF no problems arise and all images show up correctly.

Inkscape 0.47 r22583 / Ubuntu 10.04
