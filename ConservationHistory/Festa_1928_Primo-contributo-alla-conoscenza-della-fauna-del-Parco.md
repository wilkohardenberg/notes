The author undertook a first zoological survey of the Park in the summer of 1926 (22/7-12/8 and 2-23/9) [about at the same time of the poisoning of the ibex]. Visits were made from the camp in Orvieilles to the Alpe Djouan, the lake Djouan, the Lago Nero, the Col Entrelor, woods below the Orvieilles camp, woods and pastures above Eaux Rousses, Carr√®.

The author fell on 8/9 by Col Entrelor because of stones falling and had then to saty put at the camp. Short excursions could eb made again after 15/9: his collaborators were sent to visit Bocconere, Livionaz, Monte Bioula.

Some renown Italian zoologists have looked at some of the animals he gathered. Sudden death made it impossible for Bezzi to work on diptera (collected with particular care)

This is only a first contribution to the knowledge about the fauna of the national park.

p. 169 marmots are abundant around Orvieilles and very trusting

p. 170 at dusk he observed ibex going to the pastures and in the morning he saw them still pasturing around 7. With the rising sun on the pastures the moved to were the rested. But were salt had been sparsed they stayed also during the day. Around the salt deposits set up by the wardens you could see alternating groups of males and of females and youngsters, almost ever old males together with males.

By Col Entrelor he saw an eagle (looking young). Very common the sight of the "gheppio". He heard a "picchio rosso maggiore" and saw a "rondone alpino" and many "balestrucci"

p. 172 He saw many other bird species, but no _Corvus corax_ and no warden, interrogated_ said to have ever seen them. He saw only one reptile _Vipera aspis_. Neither in the lake Djouan and the lake nero he saw fishes.
