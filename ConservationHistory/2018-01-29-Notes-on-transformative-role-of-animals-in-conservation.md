In Italy the presence of animals transformed the debate about nature conservation: while this had been focused on landscapes and natural monuments, its derivation from hunting reserves made animal preservation central in the Italian case. Where else had this been the case? When else had animals been the core of the definition of national parks? African reserves? Buffalo? Bison?

Rosadi did not see the beauty of the animal. 

This centrality kept up in debate on Adamello. But got list in debates on institution of “Fascist” parks, when the core focus was mived back to landscapes and memorial value.
