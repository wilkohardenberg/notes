The production of science within the boundaries of the park appears to have been concentrated in the hands of a handful of naturalist gathered in the commission.

The scientists gaze was the same as that of the institution: most of the scientific production about the park was concentrated in three volumes produced by the royal commission. 

Outstanding is the interest for animals beyond the iconic animals: as strong as the supprt for these animals was inpractice and propaganda so astonishingly minimal was the effort to study them. Way more effort was spent in paying attention to smaller animals, mainly not even vertebrates.

Which other parks did explicity focus on animals at that time? And which ones would have in the following years, when we experienced a turn towards landscape preservation vs nature conservation. A turn from conservation in favour of tourism promotion (see also [@EnteAutonomoAbruzzo_1926_Relazione], p. 245).

Animal protection was a derivate of  pre-war debates, that led also to the institution of a handful of _Naturschutzgebiete_ in Germany, like the one around the Federsee in Württemberg, sponsored by Lina Hähnle's _Bund für Vogleschutz_. Started in 1911 as a lot of 16 ha, it grew, through succesive acquisitions, to 45 ha. Central in the German approach to conservation was the desire to avoid any possible conflict: buying land was the only way that granted this (see also the case of Hohe Tauern). The bird protection league's plan was to "provide the fauna and flora of the region a safe haven". Human impact should be avoided as far as possible, as to leave 'nature' to develop freely. The first bits were declared to total ban areas, but since some species survived well also in the 'litter meadows' surrounding the area, in later acquisitions use was allowed to some extent. This allowed the scientific comparison of used and unused areas. To broaden the reserved area the league is also thinking of renting more land, as to enclose the whole lake. An acquisition had not been possible because of the opposition of the local commons controlling the lake. The League even had planned to rent the lake's fishing right.

even if land is owned however there are still limitations to the owner's rights in favour of the rights of the community ['Allgemeinheit']: but these were favourable. The existing road, while an issue, also facilitate preservation, the needs of railroads seem to be acquitted, reclamation seems to be solved (no expectatin that a compulsory cooperative would be imposed), electricity already reaches the whole area, the phone network has been laid outside the reserve. The sheer size of the reserve also made it a hunting reserve by law. (all in Hahnle1923)
