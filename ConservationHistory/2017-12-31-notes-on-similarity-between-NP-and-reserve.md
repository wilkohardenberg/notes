The distinction between a national park and a hunting reserve is only nominal. It is a matter of who we are preserving for, a matter of constituency. Is it really relevant for the environment whether the human constituency is an individual, a community, or the state as a whole. And claims are regularly made that PNGP is one of the oldest in the world because it derives directly from a much older royal hunting reserve. Hunting reserves are indeed intended as a means to guarantee someone the possibility to exercise their hunting rights. But, once an explicit claim is made that the intention is also to preserve a whole species or a specific landscape, what is the difference in respect to a modern conservation institution?

The distinction was, as boasted by Sipari, in his Relazione of 1926, one of opening up the land from the prince to everybody. The democratisation of preservation (what strange words to hear under fascist rule, alas)

Before WWII Italy was at the avant-garde of nature protection: it boasted the second and third, working, Alpine National parks, and two more in central Italy. For a brief span of time in the early 20s government officials also claimed to have instituted a NP in southern Italy (which however then disappeared in oblivion until almost 50 years later. In the early years of the century about 20 proposal for parks had been made. In the first half of the century other proposals reached an advanced stages of development, but failed to be instituted before the war. And all this in a country that lacked wilderness, wide open lands (vs Sweden), and in which ruled a sort of cultural fear of the natural world. How did this come to be? This book tries to answer this question by focusing on Italy’s first alpine national park (and the first one formally recognized by government), but will refer multiple times to the broader story, in a narrative that jumps incessantly from the local to the national, without losing sight of the global and transnational (cit Kupper). What was the value added by preservation in Italian politics? How was it embedded in the broader political history of the country? How did the coexistence of preservation and cultural landscapes work out (vs Swiss)? What was the role of science in framing and presenting the need for conservation? What role was played by conflict and social dialectics within the framework of authoritarian fascist rule?

Environmental justice? (Cit Wakild) no, not really in my case. 

Striking similarities between Mexican revolutionary rhetoric of preservation and some claims made in the years of the transition between liberal and fascist rule in Italy ( Wakild 3): uomo nuovo —> “elevate humanity tonite highest potential”. [find more on “retorica dell’uomo nuovo” and compare preservation and alpinismo]. But practice seems so much different: did Mexico really do what fascists only claimed?

If there are two traditions (democracy and post colonial) then what about fascism (or communism, see Doug Weiner)? (wakild 5) 

[need section in intro about existing Italian lit about fascism and env. Should be short enough]

Parco del Matese just instituted: does it have a pre-WWII ideal history?
