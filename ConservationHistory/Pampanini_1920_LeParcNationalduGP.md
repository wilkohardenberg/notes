HEre, MP Rava proposes to accept the King's magnificent gift in view of the institution of a PN on the Alps, to save certain species that are peculiar to Italy and menaced to disappear, suche as the Sardinina  Mufflons, and of plants, helping also Science and Art.

p. 64 the King's proposal was aimed at preserving the ibex, since in 1918 the king had limited the hunting reserves in the GP renouncing to surveil Champorcher, Forzo, Soana and other minor valleys. Wardens reduced overall from 36 to 21 (Rhemes-Introd 7 to 4, Cogne 15 to 9, Valsavarenche 14 to 8) [bossibly personal comm from J. Brocherel 23.1.1920. This step back meant the start of a fierce hunt, in particular of the chamois.

"Cet état de choses m'était pas sans causer de graves perturbations aussi aux bouquetins, puisque l'absence des gardes préposés à leur surveillance faisait en sorte que la défense restait purement theorique"

Winter drought of 1918-1919 also helped to reduce livable area for ibex (destruction of high pastures), who was also pushed out of the region by the arrival of hunters.

Certain animals starved to death: "à Tignet, sur Valsavarenche, à 1700 m. d'altitude, des hardes de bouquetins amaigris descendaient des gorges de la Grivola pour brouter dans les champs ed dans les prés, et qu'ils se laissaient prendre avec les mains, tellement ils étaient effaiblis par la faim" cit from [AugustaPraetoria, 1919](#@_pour_1919)

Idea soon was lost in silence, except support by attorney Viglino in VdI and vow of the Province of turin 11.12.1919 for institution of a NP

Names of members of the ministerial commission of 1920 are the proof of how serious the attempt is: mainly naturalists, and knowledgeable of the region. What a differenc ein repsect to the discussion about the Parc in Livigno ten years earlier, when the opinion of naturalists wasn't even asked. or in 1913 when the envoy at the International Conference for Nature Protection in Berne was a diplomat, refusing as well to nominate a naturalist as a second envoy.

p. 65 The institution of the park, seems by now assured (sic) But what will be its characteristics

1 - extention of royal private reserves are not sufficient for the proposed aim, also because the 2100 hectares are not joined in a continuous piece of land: fractured in 5 pastures. The three smallest ones are on the right side of the Rhemes valley, the other two on the right of the Valsavarenche (almost joint, can be considered a unitary hunting reserve of about 1000 hectares)

effective protection needs protection of greater area: the whole reserve, thus the whole GP massif needs to be included.

"dans l'hypothèse et l'espoir qu'on arrive à tutéler ainsi ce noeud superbe de montagnes, il est certain que la magnificence de ses phénomènes glaciaires, la variété de ses phénomènes géologiques et géomorphiques, son altitude mème de 4061 m. qi en fait un des sommets les plus élevés d'Italie, sa richesse en raretés minérales, sa population animale et végétale renfermant des endémismes et des restes précieux, le rendraient assurément digne d'être ce premier Parc National qui devrait ouvrir une ère nouvelle dans l'histoire de la protection de la Nature en Italie."

The need is to protect 30,000 hectares

Surveillance is helped by the existence of a system of trails up to 3300 m and of royal hunting huts [infrastructure of conservation!]

Animal pop includes "loiter, hermine, blaireau, liver blanc, l'aigle, grand-duc, perdrix blanche, coq de bruyère." There are ca 1500 chamois [cit Jules Brocherel letters of 7-1-1920 and 8-1-1920] and some occasional lynx (latest lynx captured in 1888 in Rhemes Valley and one killed in 1894 in Valsavarenche, in 1909 two young lynx captured just outside the reserve by Chamolé lake and Emilius). It is even possible that the Gypaete barbu is still present, the latest killed on 23 October 1913 on becca de Toss at the begining of Val di Rhemes (2.80 m apertura alare, an old male who had been living in the area for the previous 6-7 years). VEry rare alpine species [Corriere, 2 nov. 1913 La Stampa Sportiva a. 13 n. 13 (29 marzo 1914)].

p. 67 recap of disappearnce of the ibex in the Alps

p. 68 a colony lived on the Mont-Blanc chain until it was decimated by an avalanche in 1866. The two survivors were killed in 1870 by VEII order to make it easier to control the hunting reserve of GP

p. 69 only few dozens left in early 19th c. (60-100) See Vaccari 1911 and Pampanini 1914 [???]) first ibex hunter in the royal family was prince Ferdinand, who started on July 7, 1841. VE started in 1850.

early 20th century is given with very different figures, ranging from 500 to 4000, with Falcone, 1914 giving the highest estimate.

p. 70 Pampanini believes in an estimate of about 2700. on GP 850 males, 950 females, 200 kids, on tersiva-Emilius 200 males and 500 females. Highly differntiated presence according to regions, with highest presence in Cogne and Valsavarenche. In general in winter it prefers the southern slope of the park, while in summer the northern

Pampanini hopes that the areas out of the reserve where Ibex live, such as Fenis and Champorcher valleys, Emilius, and Becca di Nona, will be included in the park, not only to protect some colonies more, but mainly to facilitate the protection of the animal in the park not leaving any animal in areas of free hunt or privare reserves, as had been done for the colony of the Mont Blanc /Courmayeur

Very rich litt. but there are aspects about which knowledge could improve. Somebody says that the colony in Fenis belongs to a bigger and stronger breed. Is this in relationship with Camerano's definition of the two forms of the species, *crassa* and *gracilis* (in his monograph on Ibex), which he attributes to the influence of the env. (in a footnote P. connects this with the case of the European bison)

p. 71 According to some authors the ibex is doomed naturally to extinction. Is the preponderance of females in some regions due only to hunting, as seems plausible? Or are there other causes?

These issues will find an answer once it will be possible to follow and study the animal in the NP, freed from such issues that now alter its natural development: "Car, si jusqu'ici la Reserve royale a parfaitement attain son but d'empêcher l'extinction du bouquets, le fait seul des battues de chasse auxquelles il est souls, malgré qu'on les conduise avec méthode et discrétion, suffit à en modifier la physionomie."

On his first hunt VEII shot 35 ibex. in August 1902 VEIII shot 42 in one 'battuta'. During the last royal hunt of 1913 in Valnontey 36 ibex and 17 chamois were killed 

p. 72 the institution of the reserve modified the principle of the law of 1821, allowing the king to hunt ibex. The Reserve made the ibex into game, while the previous legislation discussed the need to preserve animal at risk of extinction for the aims of science (in particular geology)

other intertesting animals in the regions are insects _Dichotrachelus Freyi_, _Bischoffi_, _tenuirostris_ et _Knechti_, known only at the Col de l'Arietta. (etc.)

p. 73 Pampanini also stresses the flora the park would preserve, For this it will need to include some localities around Cogne that lay outside of the reserve to save the three pearls of valdostan flora: _Astragalus alpecuroides L._, _Potentilla pensylavnica L._ var. _sangusorbifolia F.O. Wolf_, _Aethionema Thomasianum J. Gay_.

p. 76 great geomorphologic interest of the region.

p. 77 Is the park feasible?

p. 78 It would need to be larger than the reserve, to protect special plants and because the larger the better surveillance can be. It should include the high valley sof Champorcher and Fenis, the high right valley of Cogne, and Soana and Forzo to make it easier to protect. And it should reach the French border.

p. 79 at least 4000 inhabitants in the area who live of forestry and pasture (9000 in the whole of the municipalities that will be included).

MAP!!!

Cogne has even higher pop because of iron mine and tourism brought there by road infrastructure

Same issues as for PNA have to be considered

p. 80 "Ce serait absurde que de penser à empècher à la population l'exploitation de ses pâturages et de ses bois; de même ce serait absurde de renoncer à l'utilisation des grandes richesses minières et des forces hydrauliques de la région. Les limitations mêmes seraient extrêmement difficiles à imposer, en raison des trop grands frais de dédommagement qui en découleraient. Je passe sous silence d'autres difficultés d'ordre morale, résultant de l'ensemble de ces droits traditionnels dont jouissent les montagnards et auxquels trop difficilement ils renonceraient."

Issue of conflict between use of water for energy production and landscape preservation already apparent in those years, as can be seen in footnote.

but limiting the parc only to the highest peaks where all these issues would be  absent, would make the park useless.

Only areas that would not present any issue are the Royal reserves in Rhemes and Valsavarenche because they are Royal property.

A possibility would be to split the park in two regions, as proposed already for PNA: a strict reserve in the royal reserves, while the rest would be declared only a partial reserve. In this way however, claims Pampanini, we would impose a strict reserve on areas that have only the slightest interest for protection: there is nothing exceptional in their flora, fauna, or geology.

p. 81 "Si on veut que le Parc puisse répondre à son but fondamental, non seulement il est à écarter toute intervention directe de l'homme, qui en altérerait la physionomie naturelle, mais il devrait s'étendre sur une surface assez vaste afin que la vie de sa population végétale et surtout celle de sa population animale — bien plus susceptible de ressentir les conséquences nuisibles du voisinage de l'homme — n'aient pas à éprouver les modifications inévitables qu'apporte ce voisinage. La physionomie du territoire doit pouvoir retrouver les traits de sa réalité primitive!" (Think Swiss!!!) cit [Arrigoni, 1919](#@arrigoni_degli_oddi_riserve_1919)

dispersion of colonies accellerates extinction as much as direct destruction

Rules in the partial reserve limited to existing rules of the royal reserve, plus possibly some rules defending the eagle and other predators, or banning plant collection in some areas and for some species.

P. believes that a park in GP only can be realised in this minimal dimension ("sa plus modeste expression")

In 1911 in _Per la protezione della Flora italiana_ Pampanini had proposed that botanical reserves along the lines of the one instituted on the Königsee or in Denmark at Schlossgehege were set up in the Italian royal hunting reserves. Motion approved unanimously by SocBotIt in its meeting of 13 Oct 1911, but remained a platonic vow.

"On pourra en tracer les contours sur la carte, lui donner une existence juridique par une loi dûment émanée. tout cela pourra suffire à montrer l'intention de créer un Parc National, mais n'aura aucun résultat pratique si on ne lui assure pas aussi une surveillance effective." (see Jacoby)

and the surveillance need to be continuous and energetic because in Italia il rispetto delle leggi lascia sovente a desiderare, especially those regarding wood cutting, pasurtage and hunting.

p. 82

laws reflect to waekly public opinion and end needing to substitute it, instead of guiding it. Withou the coop of citizensn the more power a lwa needs to be enforced.

Biggest coefficient of success of the royal reserve  has been the loyalty of the mountain people towards the king. But the relaity is that with war and its moral crisis this sentiment may have dwindled. He does not exclude that the reserve may end up as badly as the one in the Marsica, left by the royal house in 1912. 

passage from private royal admin to public one by the state is a disadvantage

To keep up the same level of protection, surveillance will need to be even more strict. "The state always need more powerful means to reach an aim, than a private person." moreover, what is owned by the Stat is considered _res nullius_, not only by the public, but even by those who are in charge of defending it. 

Refers to the annaul report for SNP and claims that once the surveillance will be granted a methodic analysis of the region will be possible as to face the other problems that the park's dev may have.

But how to finance? the state has accepted? But has the government made plans to fund the park?

p. 83 if this is not the case it is doubtable that the park will be set up.

Preserving the ibex cannot be the park's only aim, otherwise it will be only a change in name for the royal reserve. The immediate aims (preserving the ibex, some other species, and plants) shoudl notdistract from the bigger aims: beside the "conservation integrale" of part of the country, it shall aim to the moral education of the nation.

war has made fail many conservation initiatives and compromised the existence fo the ibex, but "VEIII, en proposant un remède plus general et plus conforms à l'esprite du Rescrit de 1821 — digne des temps nouveaux, puisqu'il implique la reconnaissance officielle, longtemps attendue, d'un principle d'ordre moral et scientifique — et en offrant le moyen de le realiser, il merite plus que jamais la gratitude des savants et de tous ceux qui aimend le pays du Val d'Aoste pour lequel, sous ce rapport, le nom de VEIII doit être desormais intimement lié à celui de soin aïeul, le «Roi Chasseur»."
