Ironically, around WWI Italian scholars and conservationists lived under the impression that everybody else in the Alpine region was already setting up, in one form or the other, dedicated institutions of conservation. [Mader 1914, 179](#@mader_per_1914) in his plea for the institution of a NP on the Serra dell'Argentera (another area that was already protected as Royal hunting reserve) lists, in fact, not only the SNP, but also the plans for "similar reserves" in Germany and the Austrian Alps, and the La Berarde Park in France. As we have said earlier conservation can take different shapes, and the title of national park isn't much more than just a moniker. One could say that the botanical reserve around the Königsberg was, by all means, a NP. Or that the same was true for the land owned around the Pasterze by the Döav. Both lacked however what [Pampanini, 1920a](#@pampanini_parc_1920) called the moral dimension a NP ought to have. Less rhetorically we could say that the lacked either the all-encompassing power of a NP or, just, an actual national dimension, since they were private initiatives (see Douglas Thompson and the setting aside of land in Chile today).

Ironically, we said, because this peer pressure led Italy, after the war ended up being the second ALpine nation setting up a national park by all chrismes.
