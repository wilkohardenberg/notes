This book ended being vastly different from how it had been initially conceived. From an overview of localised and diverse conflict, to the detailed and multifaceted story of just one park. This, in the end, is  what I believe is needed at this stage to understand the role of fascism in shaping materially nature conservation in Italy. The choice of 1950 as the final date of my story, rather than the end of WWII and of the fascist regime, allows alos to bring to the forefront the continuities in the history of Italian conservation, rather than stressing once more the old historiographical model of fascism as a parenthesis in Italian history. It also reshapes the whole narrative into one of the "nature state" before the Great Acceleration, an account that focuses on conservationism, rather than environmentalism, as a source of conflict and social dialectics. The book thus addresses the issue of how the "nature state" came to be shaped even before modern environmentalism arose and interacted with other actors, both locally, nationally and globally.
