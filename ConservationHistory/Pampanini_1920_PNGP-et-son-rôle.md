p. 193 "Atteints par ce qui a ete défini come _notre defaut organique_, la facility à passer de l'enthousiasvme au découragement, nous rend plus prets à exposer un projet qu'à le mûrir et à le réaliser. Nous réussissons bien difficilement  dans le travail de coordination, car la constance et la discipline ne sont pas nos qualités dominantes. Et c'est précisément cet esprit de la Nature ailleurs, dans l'Europe Central et surtout en Allemagne." In Italy smaller group traditionally more effective than masses!

p. 194 the lack of coordinative power has damned many good initiatives. Many separate and uncoordinated initiatives, with often too big aims. This reduced their effectiveness, also because of duplication: "plus la direction du mouvement sera centralise et plus elle sera agile; plus l'objectif sear limité et précis et plus il sera aisé de coordonner les efforts qui y conduisent". [pre-fascist tendencies???]

Societies should split tasks and focus, so that they become complementary. This would suppress unneeded interferences: follow the Swiss and German example were Heimatschutz and Naturschutz have separate societies. Separation of work makes cooperation more useful.

Lega Nazionale soon paralised and inert. But not vain. Could be revitalised by the institution of PNGP.

p. 195 since it has shown 'impotente' to live autonomously why not 'risuscitarla' as an annex of the park?

The Park's immediate aims (save the ibex and the even more difficult one to be a reserve also for its other animal and vegetal species) are the least important.

Higher aims are necessary: "un parc ne doit pas avoir seulement le but d'instruire; mais il doit en avoir aussi un autre beaucoup plus haut: celui d'éduquer."

The Lega Nazionale has been abstend from all major activities since the International conference for nature protection of 1913 to the Parks commission of Pro Montibus. Together with the Comitato Nazionale of the Toruing it couldn't find a better way to survive than joining forces with the future park's administration. Again the Swiss model is invoked.

p. 196 the principle of nature protection is more moral and intellectual than material.

"Si les restrictions de la loi sont trop severes, il arrive meme tres facilement qu'en heurtant contre des interet economiques, au lieu de reprimer des abus, elle en cree de nouveuaux et multiplie les obstacles sur le chemin de l'idee." All restrictions, in particular those on property rights, always create conflict and resistance. Its not laws that lack, but rather their practical application, as noticed about flora protection by avv. J. Giuriati: "what we need are not new laws, but vigorous initiatives to obtain the application of the existing ones. Lets correct this organic weakness that consists of remediating to our too evident neglicences by augmenting the number and the breadth of legislation" Cit in Pampanini 1912

p. 197 in nota si parla di caccia ad uccelli e della relativa legislazione

p. 198 since the idea of the importance of nature protection has grown out of its initial phase, its diffusion only among a limited number of scholars and scientists, it needs now to develop in the public and grow deep into the conscience of the Nation. You can't love what you don't know.

but talking to the public often means to be talking to a desert. indifference challenges the most willing spirits. Propaganda needs to be preceded by education, starting with children. Cites Passerini: _Sui rapporti fra gli uccelli, gli insetti e le piante_ (Atti R Acc Georgof 4. Serie, XXIII 1900 p, 25 ) and Minio _Dell'uso e dell'efficacia delle osservazioni e delle esperienze scientifiche nella scuola primaria_ (Boll di Mat e Sc Fis e Nat, vol XVI 1914-15, p. 60)

See also p. 199 when he discusses the role of schools in this task.

p. 200 gives positive example of pro montibus and its attempt to raise the forestal conscience through reforestation efforts allowed  by a law of July 17 1910.

Festa degli alberi introdotta da Baccelli il 27 giugno 1899 e rivitalizzata dalla Pro montibus nel 1911 rivalutandone il valore educativo. Done following US example (arbor day and bird's day). Could be hint towards instituting a "Day of the protection of nature". A similar day adopted in Vienna and Basel since 1911 (_Naturschutztag_).

p. 202 Italian conservationists should not expect that their movement shall reach soon the same level it already has in other parts of Europe.

Vaccari had started propaganda on horticultural and hunting journals in favour of the Lega Nazionale: Bull Ass Ort Prof It a. II, 1914, Bull R Soc Tosc Ort vol XXXIX 1914, Diana a. IX 1914 and X 1915.

p. 206 "La valeur de la Nature, fait judgement remarker M. Ginzberger, consists d'abord dans le fait que nous en raisins partie. Ce serait nous voter à une auto-destruction que de n'apprecier que ce qui est loeuvre de la main de l'homie." a generation has to be interested in those that will follow. 

p. 207 the destruction of an animal species is a reduction of the common good in the present time and for the future an irreparable loss. The systematic study of nature is still in its infancy.
