current situation of Danube not understood and sustainability not planned if common past of the Danube is not analyzed

EH as teamwork

practice routinized way in which bodies are moved, objects are handled, subjects are treated things are described and the world is understood (@Reckwitz 2002)

arrangements: material precipitates of practices

*Socio-natural site*: nexus between practices and arrangement

Work as interventio: it is available through practices and is an intervention into material arrangements

if practice changes also the arrangement changes and viceversa

Environmental history studies the effect of these changes

Human beings via practices create arrangements to harvest exergy from the material world

Arrangements as part of the evolutionary setting of humankind, because of the evolution of one of the actors. 

(Red Queen hypothesis?)

Autopoetic change in arrangements is the norm.

Legacies of earlier preventions have profound impact on our and our descendants' practices.

need to perceive environment to construct arrangements; and depends on our perception, how we construct them
Perception is linked to motives of the perceiving actor and inescapably subjective and cultural and emotionally constructed

a sustsoc based on renewable energy will have to deal with the legacies from exergy-denze arrangements.

only in longterm perspective the difference between pre-industrial and industrial arrangements may be understood.
