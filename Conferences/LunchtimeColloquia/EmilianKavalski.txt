@RBJWalker "Inside/Outside" how the inside of the state impacts on the outside

Global life = interwoveness between human and non-human systems

Study of complexity provides different way to approach study of global life

Complexity as a relationship between participants, each being a complex system on its own (that is constituted by complex relationships)

Emergence 	- 	(i) whole more than sum of parts
				(ii) small changes in initial conditions affect outcomes
Dynamic 	-	change is constant, stability is an illusion --> @EnviroHistory: what is conservation, what is sustainability if change is constant?
Open 		- 	systems are interconnected
Decentralized	- 	complex systems cannot be reconstituted

!!!Overrunning simple causal relationships!!!
The concept of complexity is often misunderstood and IR scientists are unwilling to look beyond the human

--> conflict and complexity
--> conservation as simplification process (@JamesScott)

Natural disasters ignored from IR security discourses because there is no human cause
Security as control, security as resilience

@Ursula How do you conceive systems? In anthro people tend not to work in systems, but rather in flows -
Defined as something that has boundaries. The notion of limits is what distinguishes one system from the other. But who defines a 	boundary??? In different disciplines complexity and in general wording may assume different meanings

@coulterk relationship ANT/complexity? reception? -
ANT/agent-base modeling as one methodology for studying complexity
reception was lukewarm

Complexity as a new way of thinking about the world and forcing to adopt new ways to understand it
