The one thing you cannot do is eliminate Dublin Core fields (but you can choose not to show them)
Tricky aspect is that an item can only exist is one collection (built on museum model -> items come shipped within one collection)

There is a controlled vocabulary plugin (assign a limited number of options to fields)
It would be possible to adapt the LoC plugin to European context

Dublin Core Data never get deleted (while you can delete the fields that YOU add)

It is not possible to build subcollections -> hope to use SETS plugin to indicate level of subcollections

How to insert existing data not by hand? --> CSV --> possibility to map fields in the CSV to Omeka fields (wow!)

Omeka has a Zotero importer

Different access levels: super / contributor (using plugin) / researcher (see public and private items, but not modify them) / admin (slightly less powers thab super at highest level) --> manageable in settings/users

You can build exhibits with any item from your collections - exhibits have their own metadata

Exhibit page layout is customizable (did I get it right?)

You are not stuck to Dublin core: you can use also metadata sets linked to your specific craft (art historian/archivists/librarians)

Dublin Core easily mapped to other standards --> using standards exportng becomes much easier.

Hosting Omeka.net very useful for teaching purposes

Problem with Dublin Core is that (on purpose) it is vague.
