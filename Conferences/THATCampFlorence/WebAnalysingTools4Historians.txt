Created Wednesday 23 March 2011

rpad - more science oriented
[[http://rstudio.org|rstudio.org]] new R IDE for Ubuntu (check against rkward) comes also with server version for sharing analysis

wanted to produce something that was accustomed to the needs of an historian

historians (as opposed to stats) feel free to do things that are note allowes: group data as to show what I am looking for (really???)

This systems allows an historian to do stats without learnng a new software 

looking at the data helps the historian to change the coding of given variables (learning by doing?)
looking for a graphical representation that best suits my needs (cheating?)

since we write (actually construct from archival data) our data as historians we feel allowed to correct the data according to their visualization

need for sharing data in the historical community / 
# need for open historical data repositories
# it arises copyright issues with archives et al. (or doesn't it?)

two different softwares: stat analysis

- Historian as a critical being
- historians ad their sources: a close relationship
- Data process as a work process

LIMITS: 1) many ways to history 2) Historian as an ogre: hungry for datas

#[unrelated] [[http://onearth.jpl.nasa.gov|onearth.jpl.nasa.gov]] FREE WMS (if it is still working)

how to use Business Intelligence for Historians
Common problems  data integration because data come from heterogeneous and distributed sources
Need to extract and transform data
from -> being optimised for transaction to -> being optimised for analysis

ETL [ectract/Transform/Lsomething] tools save time and money, since they avoid handcoding

Pentaho open source BI product -> most comprehensive tool set / fastes t growing open source suite
able to produce data for data mining (Kettle/Mondrian/JPivot/Weka(R)]
Uses standalone Java engine [
