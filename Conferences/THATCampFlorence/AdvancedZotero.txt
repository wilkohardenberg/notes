====== AdvancedZotero ======
Created Thursday 24 March 2011

[[http://zotero.org/download/plugins/zoteromaps-1.0.10.xpi|ZoteroMaps]] able to map places of publication or cited in the attachments. (may be able to look for coordinates, maybe you will have to add them in place field or in a custom field [may come with future architecture of Zotero])

by now there is a zotero collection embedding plugin for :Colloquia:THATCampFlorence:WordPress --> ScholarPress Researcher (maybe not yet publicly available --> on clioweb's GitHub

ScholarPress Workshop lets you create Zotero items w/out using Zotero: for example to gather papers for a workshop cfp (but not only: modifying the plugin it is possible to gather any kind of Zotero Item

there are tabs to create your own APIKey and there are keys for specific collections

Timeline seems a very powerful tool to have a glance at the chronological distribution of your sources (whole library or single collections) --> and highlight specific parts of it.

You can highlight text and make annotations from Zotero

Excellent Firefox annotation extension: [[http://www.libertexto.org/|LiberTexto]] --> cooperation with Zotero is planned (it even can annotate pdfs) currently works only on Firefox 3.x

Duplicates? resolving dupliocates is one of the biggest projects they are working at the moment
