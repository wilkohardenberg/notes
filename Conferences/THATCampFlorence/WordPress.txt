====== WordPress ======
Created Thursday 07 April 2011

WP easy enough to allow a scholar to learn it w/out too much hassle

CMS (dBase) easier than Dreamweaver because the dBase makes it more powerful (allow to change a word in the websote only once and have it changed everywhere)

→ extensibility (humanist philosophy) → plugins leads it to be very customizable and it assumes WP doesn't know everything

Some unis see WP as a security risk because if you do not update regularly there are security risks.
