It is a whole suite of applications
PkAdmin can be used to create the schema of an ontological model
PkInput populate onto model
PkQuery makke questions to onto mofdel
Repository stores data about onto models

Ontologies: explicit formalizations of shared conceptualisation --> technology to represente knowledge
they may be compared with relational dbases

Upper ontology --> only very hgh concepts shared by many domains
Domain ontology --> domain-specific 
Applicatioon ontology --> very specific

Ontology languages: URI, XML, RDF, OWL

The components of an ontoloy are classes and predicates (relation between classes) 
# It occurs to me that I've already done all this last year in Dublin, the question is where I've left those notes

useful to give a formal representation of a text -->  from image to transcription
in fact transcription usually loses format (transverse writing/underlining/special signs usw. --> paratesto)

@amandafrench 6:46pm via Seesmic twhirl - Looking only at ontology, Pinakes seems a decent database-backed alternative to TEI for manuscripts. Haven't seen interface, tho. #thatcamp

Different from TEI

It is an autonomous ontology, built from scratch (felt it was the faster option) --> portability to other onyologies is planned

You use annotations to describe/conceptualize fragments of texts
The same ontology is used in various projects / and the model can be extended / what is the same is the approach

the interface will probably be usable in a few months!!!
Users need to know something about ontologies!
