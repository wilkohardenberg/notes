====== Crowdsourcing ======
Created Thursday 24 March 2011

Jeff Howe "The rise of crowdsourcing" Wired June 2006

Interest:
- gathering documents (mostly privately held) --> going beyond traditional archives / obtain more sources
- keeping track of current events
 
Rosenzweig & Cohen book about gathering and preservation of digital history

LoC project putting texts on flickr and have them annotated by the public --> problems with spam/quality
 
@inactinique You need a community, but a project can work also with a small community (photosnormandie). 

@wilkohardenberg community needs momentum and in this it his helped by media, but it has not media support from the beginning -->HistoryPIN

@FedericoMazzini commenting crowdosurcing gives new perspective on what a person can be on the internet (anonimity)

options for crowdsourcing data and docs for E&S website?
what are the options to filter crowdsourced data?
 what does the person doing crowdsourcing get out of it? this is the question we should pose ourselves: people should be rewarded --> do we need a reward for filtering?
@sergenoiret only reward: I am part of the story (central aspect in crowdsourcing)

you need to give back to the community: e.g. if you produce a book from crowdsourced material you should somehow give back to the people that originally provided you data

keeping crowdsourced added data separated from institutional data
