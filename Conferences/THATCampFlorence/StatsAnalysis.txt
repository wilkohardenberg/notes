====== StatsAnalysis ======
Created Friday 25 March 2011

@PhRygiel development of stat analysis tools with online interface and offer to historian and social scientists a tool that reduces the learning curve

they are not sure that their choices are always sound need feedback

how does an historian build the dataset he is going to use for stats?

traditional statistical methods do not consider the fuzzyness and frequent unreliability of historical data

being based on R, the online doesn't offer anything more than R for desktop: why am I here?

need to go back to the source after having performed the analysis

sometimes analysis is embedded within historical data production

@stakats data is cheap, and getting always cheaper. what costs is analysis (or)
@stakats: Debating historians' hoarding of sources. But when data is cheap, they need to rethink the value they add. 

@PhRygiel coding to be made after the first analysis of data has been performed

Techies may have an advantage from working on historical research: e.g. checking reliability of algorithms in extreme conditions --> not a **seller/client** relationship
