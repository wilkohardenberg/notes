human domination as a social system

from territories and borders to systems [borders are central in my analysis, but I aim also at looking at the Alps and at their subregions as systems, going beyond human-centered and nation-based divisions --> nature does not see borders]

what is order? absence of conflict

The adaptive cycle

R - abundant resources - exploitation
K - stagnation - victim of your own growth (vulnerable to external chocs) -  conservation
Omega - release phase - release
Alpha - reorganization - reorganization

Institutions are difficult to change (path dependency, they reflect power structures and relationship that led to their creation) @Duit andreas.duit@statsvet.su.se
