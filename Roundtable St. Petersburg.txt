HMAP History of Marine Animal Populaton --> project ended last year

A large chunk of history depends on nature, but historians do not want to hear that, thinking that the whole of history is man-made

Verena Winiwarter - Venetian example about oaks and the need to know ecology to produce effective regulations. Probably contemporary environmental policy works more or less the same 

Need to become a UNO consultant, therefore the need of ICEHO, the international society (a Euro only association would not have been accepted)

Sverker - humanities at large have a crisis. Their usefulness is put under discussion. Their original purpose was national construction, but by now this is not that much neededif not dangerous. New scope could be environmental humanities. Humanists should take the lead im guiding humanity out of the current crisis (religion/environment). Stockholm Resilience Centre. We can now talk of NEW human condition (Arendt), the link to the new humanities.

Environment is 'naturally' at the centre of Finnish historical research. // difference in respect to Italian history, where everything is substantially cultural/social/political.

New environmental narratives are important in building museums --> local history
And eh and tech hist for technological universities --> perspectives for development of eh in Russia - Alexandrev


Winiwarter produced teaching material for high school teachers
