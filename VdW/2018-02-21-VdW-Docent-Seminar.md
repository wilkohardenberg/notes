ask Nadin Hee?

there is no standard text: you don't know what they'll know

find discoursive and writing formats that bring the students in and give them opportunity to work something up from their perspective and disciplinary field.

clustering exercise? see about what methods/interests students would want to meet and work together.

students tend to plan too large projects!!!! they lack perspective on scale

how to get people to participate in conversation? 

extracurricolar?

discussion rules? 

need to socialize students:

- walk and discuss
- write on boards
- make that they get to know each other / icebreakers
- gamification?
- Methodenkarussel: students supposed to introduce methods from their fields
  - reflection about methods through examples
  - led people to think what a method is

what is the fair amount of work that I can expect from students? 

- need to adjust amount of work to the fact that it is only 3 ECTS

Less homework, more has to be done in seminar.



How to organize archival material:

- Need to collect material on my own; or
- Select date that works for many to go to achive; or
- Just let them go; or
- Don't care and only work on published material

What is their technical knowledge?

- what can they bring to the technical aspects of the seminar product?
- not impose tools?

Keep outcome open
