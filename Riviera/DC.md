Practicalities and local needs appear to determine our position to the choice of the most relevant reference point marking the boundary between land and sea. If our relationship to the sea is, so to say, defensive, we'll be mainly interested in the highest high tide, thus the farthest inland point reached by the sea in it regular movements. The _Amsterdam Pegel_, devised to ascertain flooding risks in an area robbed from the sea, is in fact the marker of average high tide. And in general high tide marks coastlines, thus the extreme boundary of land strict. Nautical chart datums instead, explicitly intended to facilitate navigation, refer to some iteration of low or lowest low tide, as to always indicate the minimum available depth of water. The Irish ordnance datum however also refers to this. In between these extremes exist a region that is neither land nor sea, as noted already by various authors. What exist also in an abstract fashion is the mean sea level.
