1841 &quot;My principal object in visiting Port Arthur was to afford a comparison of our standard barometer with that which had been employed for several years by [Mr. Lempriere](http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/L/TJ%20Lempriere.htm),[^1] the Deputy Assistant Commissary General in accordance with my instructions, and also to establish a permanent mark at the zero point, or general mean level of the seas as determined by the tidal observations which Mr Lempriere had conducted with perseverance and exactness for some time: by which means any secular variation in the relative level of the land and sea, which is known to occur on some coasts, might at any future period be detected, and its amount determined. The point chosen for this purpose was the perpendicular cliff of the small islet off Point Puer, which, being near to the tide register, rendered the operation more simple and exact; the governor, whom I had accompanied on a official visit to the settlement, gave directions to afford Mr. Lempriere every assistance of labourers he required, to have the mark cut deeply in the rock in the exact spot which his tidal observations indicated as the mean level of the ocean. The tides in the Derwent were too irregular, being influenced greatly by the prevalence of winds outside and the freshes from the interior, so that we could not ascertain with the required degree of exactness the point of mean level. It would have been desirable to have fixed a similar mark on some part of the opposite side of the island, but a prolonged series of preliminary observations of these tides are necessary, and as these had not been obtained, and our limited stay, as well as the full employment for all our observers, which the necessary experiments with the magnetometers provided, did not admit of our doing it, I can only hope that some individual with like zeal for science with Mr. Lempriere, and with time at his disposal, may yet accomplish this desideratum. I may here observe, that it is not essential that te mark be made exactly at the mean level of the ocean, indeed it is more desirable that it should be rather above the reach of the highest tide: it is, however, important that it be made on some part of a solid cliff, not liable to rapid disintegration, and the exact distance above the mean level (which may also be marked more slightly) recorded on a plate of copper, well protected from the weather, by placing a flat stone with cement between, upon the plane surface or platform which should constitute the mark from which the level of mean tide should be measured. [See [Cosmos](http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/kosmos-erster-band-6674/14), p. 288 (Sabine) {p. 298 Ottè}. And note, p. 95].[^2]

The most desirable position for such another mark would be near the north-west extremity of the island, and in the vicinity of Cape Grim, near which the Van Diemen's Land Company has a small establishment.

The fixing of solid and well secured marks for the purpose of showing the mean level of the ocean at the given epoch, was suggested by Baron von Humboldt in a letter to Lord Minto, subsequent to the sailing of the expedition, and of which I did not receive any account until our return from the Antarctic seas, which is the reason of my not having established a similar mark on the rocks of Kerguelen Island, or some part of the shores of Victoria Land. Upon this subject that great philosopher observes, that 'if similar measures had been taken in Cook and Bougainville's earliest voyages, we should now be in possession of the necessary data for determining whether secular variation in the relative level of land and sea is a general or merely a local phenomenon, and whether any law is discoverable in the direction of the points which rise or sink simultaneously'.[^3]&quot;[^4]

December 1842 &quot;The mean level of the sea was deduced from five months' observations; and two permanent marks were made 5 feet 8 inches above it, first by levelling the top of a rock a little to the southward of the pier and watering place; and again by cutting a ledge in the face of the cliff close by it. Two copper plates were fixed in the rocks, marked thus '5 feet 8 inches above the mean level of the ocean, August, 1842., H.B.M. ships Erebus and Terror;' by which any difference that may occur in the level of the sea in those parts may readily be detected.&quot;[^5]

In a 1829, in a talk given on November 16 at the academy of sciences in St. Petersburg Humboldt insisted on the necessity to &quot;rigorously determine&quot; the _courbe die hauteur zero_, a geodetical line passing through all points in the Aralo-Caspian basin positioned at the same height of the level of the Black Sea or of the Ocean. He also suggested to fix brass markers in the rocky part of the Caspian coast, as to mark the mean level of the sea. This was done in 1830 by M. Lenz near the fortress in Baku. More he suggested to be placed by Ross during in his expedition in the austral hemisphere as to answer more general questions about the physics of the globe. What Humboldt believes to be particularly important is the possibility to compare every 30 years the mean level of the Caspian Sea on the two opposed banks. Indeed it is possible that the sea doesn't have the same movements at different points along its coasts.[^6]

&quot;A provisionary calculation, published by the renown astronomer from Dorpat, M. de Struve, gave the level of the Caspian Sea 15t,8 (94 _pieds de roi_) lowe than the level of the Black Sea. But the definite result which owe to the friendship of the same scholar (letter from Pulkova, July 24, 1839) is, according to calculations

 by M . Sawitshc 80 English feet

 By M. Sabler 82.8 &quot; In the average 12t,72 or 81.4 English feet

This he believes is the final setting of the height of the Caspian Sea (1837). Lists therefore a few of the most significant attempts made by barometric means. Chappe (Voy. En Siberie, t. II, 487-91) determines the &quot;evidently absurd&quot; value of 51 toises through data gathered by Dr. Leere in Astrakhan 1732-49…. Coincidence of the barometric value gathered by Chrétien Mayer (on data gathered by Lerche), with the value determined by trigonometric means in 1837. Goes on and on….[^7] Less certain is relative level of Aral Sea, which only could be determined by a chain of barometric measurements.

The geodetic line of height zero, the one reuniting all points at the level of the Black Sea goes through the Volga between Zaritzin and Saratov. As remarked by de Struve the zero height line encompasses an area that is way broader than the Caspian Sea.[^8]

Interesting example made using the blocking of Gibraltar to explain the formation of the Caspian depression.[^9]

Differences in sea levels of 5 T found by Le Père in Suez, half a T in Panama by Lloyd and Falmarc are completely different issues: effects of currents and of the main direction of wind, height of tides reflected by shape of coasts and variations of the planets density. M. Arago apparently discusses issue of amount of water that enters or leaves a bay and its impact on the local level of the sea.[^10]

In &quot;Asie Central&quot; from p. 325 comparison of global levellings: Panama, Mediterranean and Red Sea, Med and Atlantic Ocean (minimal according to Coraboeuf and Delcros), Adria vs Med (recently noticed elevation of northern Adria, 7m diff…). Humbolt thought it to be important to recap all known on _hypsometrie hydraulique comparée,_ on water that are (or are not part) of the same level surface. Physical geography cannot progress if not by regrouping results that have already been obtained, discussing the fondaments of numerical elements, raising to the general insights.[^11]

Invitation to trace a _ligne de sonde_ of all points exactly at the height of the Baltic and Black Sea around the Caspian Basin and to set markers. Further markes should be set around the whole coast of the sea, following the example of the markers set a century earlier along the Swedish coast by the Academy in Stockholm. Aim would be to understand whether there is a general or partial, continuous or periodic lowering of the level of water. Or if it is due to a continental elevation due to volcanic causes (as suggested by Leopold de Buch for Sweden).[^12]

Se M. Delcros as important geodesist of first half of 19th C.

Accordingot to Beckinsale and Chorley, much of Suess second volume 1888 focussed on historical work discussing sea-level changes, paying attention in particular to the conflict between Neptunists (&quot;who believed in the dominance of absolute sea-level movements&quot;) and Tectonists (&quot;who placed much more emphasis on localized vertical displacements of the earth's surface&quot;). Much of this discussed in Volume 1 of _The History of the Study of Landforms._[^13]

&quot;In the early nineteenth century both John Playfair and Leopold von Buch decided that Sweden was in the process of being elevated, and the former expressed a clear preference for imputing changes of level to vertical motions of the land rather than to oscillations of sea level which would be worldwide.&quot; &quot;Diastrophists&quot; were outnumbered by distinguished geologists as Cuvier, Brongniart and Prevost &quot;who believed in the sinking of the sea rather than the elevation of the land. Details and more counterpoints listed in Beckinsale.[^14]

&quot;Forming a groundswell to the whole discussion and being the explicit subject of volume 2 (Suess 1888) was the assumption that, apart from the orogenic belts, evidencesof continental transgressions and regressions point to a remarkable synchronicity of swings of sea level in widely spacedareas of the globe. The apparently extensive and uniform character of these events prompted Suess to suggest that, apart from certain local movements, the continental areas of the world had been absolutely stable throughout geological time, and that the main onlaps and offlaps of the ocean had resulted from worldwide shifts of sea level due mainly to changes in the capacity of the ocean basins&quot;[^15]

Mechanisms suggested by Suess:

- bodily disposition of ocean waters due to gravitational attraction of alternating polar ice-caps. See also Adhemar 1842 (in MPIWG Library)
- sedimentation alternating with sudden subsidence

&quot;In his _Principles_ Lyell provides a copiously illustrated account, in a chapter on lands experiencing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, of elevation and subsidence in the Bay of Baiae near Naples as shown by horizontal bands of borings by marine bivalves on three tall marble columns of the Temple of Sorapis  … 'the interminable controversies to which the phenomena of the Bay of Baiae gave rise, have sprung from an extreme reluctance to admit that the land, rather than the sea, is subject alternately to rise and fall. (Lyell 1875: II: 178-9)'&quot;[^16]

Publication in 1891 of _Challenger_ expedition, most important deep –sea expedition until post WWII era, results on volume of deep-sea deposits drew attention to importance of land-derived deposits. The mapping of ocean deeps prompted &quot;speculation regarding the deformation and changes in capacity of the ocean basins&quot;.[^17]

In 1875 Suess produced _Die Entstehung der Alpen_

The French edition became the definite one of _Das Antlitz der Erde_. Volume 2 introduced the idea of _eustasy_ &quot;signifying a general and uniform change of world sea level.&quot; &quot;Suess was utterly ruthless in incorporating any evidence, however trivial, which might appear to favour changes of sea level and in incidentalizing or blittiling what is assumed to be the ineffectual impact of the 'theory of elevation'. Suess' great work must be read several times, at long intervals, before its bias can be fully appreciated&quot;. Suess had always been a militant eustasist: various examples provided.[^18]

Chambers (1848) uses the expression 'changes of relative level' instead of elevation and subsidence with approval of Suess. Denies usefulness of theory of elevation for the Baltic: changes of density of water due to salinity in closed sea much more efficient in explaining.[^19]

Section on Suess in Chorley 1993, 71-77

Eustatic theory greatly helped by Penck's _Morphologie der Erdoberfläche_ of 1894 and by early 20th c. eustasy had become a basic article of &quot;geological faith&quot;.[^20]

Grabua widened Suess theory with 'pulsation theory', alleging that eustatic changes followed rhythmic pulsation. Role of development of oil dirlling in Gulf Coast Plain in 1920s on development stratigraphy.[^21]

&quot;In the 1930s many influential geologists subscribed to the view that '… the major movements of the strand line … have affected all continents in the same sense at the same time' (Bucher 1933: 428) and caused by changes in basin capacity (Moore 1936: 1802-4). Post 1930 diastrophic tide turned around against eustatic theory: &quot;gowring disbelief in the reality of long periods of absolute quiescence and in the fundamental stability fo the earth's crust&quot;. Various examples of crust uplift provided.[^22]

Charles MacLAren in 1842 discussing Agassiz suggested that sea-level was lower during ice ages.

Estimates of the possible drop of sea level during the Pleistocene proliferated (p. 82 in Chorley/BEckinsale: 3)

During the late 1920s and 1930s a great effort was made to correlate marine benches and fluvial terraces on a global scale (p. 86)

Reality of recent lower sea levels maintained by studies of various things (p. 87). HOW RECENT???

Baulig, The Changing Sea Level, 1935

Triangulation of Algeria began in 1854 and lasted until 1994.23

&quot;Everything he saw convinced Webb that these were the highest mountains in the world, but he had no hard evidence until 1810, when he fixed the mountain known to him as Dhaulagiri from four survey stations in the plains and came up with a height of 26,862 feet. He was right within 68 feet. But back in Europe, where geographers had long since settled that the Andes were the world's highest mountains, Webb's findings were generally dismissed as the fevered imaginings of the East. Not until George Everest brought the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India to the north in the 1830s would the preeminent stature of the Himalaya be put beyond dispute.&quot;[^24]
