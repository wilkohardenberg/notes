The first explicit mention of the need toactually measure the “mean height of the sea” was made by William Whewell on anarticle about the diurnal inequality of the tide. Here he recognized also theexistence of a fluctuation of this height. He adopts the mean height, definedas the mean between low water and high water as they are registered each day. Inall the cases he looks at the mean tide level appeared to be “very nearly”constant: “This is most remarkable at Singapore, where, though the successivelow waters often differ by six feet, the mean level only oscillates through afew inches.” HE noticed a less constant MTL in Plymouth. 

Whewell contests directly the phrase “Thelevel of the sea at low water” as used by surveyors, because it is wrong andmay lead to error. This article seems to be the first explicit mention of theneed to look at the mean level of the sea as an approximation of the sea’ssurface level.

Huge differences in low level in placesthat are near to one another are best example of the fact that low level of thesea cannot be level, because it would be “quite inconsistent with the laws ofthe tides”. [cit: William Whewell 1794-1866., “Researcheson the Tides, Seventh Series: On the Diurnal Inequality of the Height of theTide Especially at Plymouth and at Singapore and on the Mean Level of the Sea,”*Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society*, 1837, 75–85.] 

 In Tides of History (ToH) a mention is made of acorrespondence between Whewell and an Alexander Becher about the measurement oftides in mid-sea (185-7) and the existence of a no tide zone.

Lubbock an elementary treatise on tides

Reidy finishes where I start: 274-281.Reidy talks of “vertical consciousness”

Reidy suggests that scientists followedHumboldt’s land bound heed to also gather data about the oceans (ToH, 275).Actually Humboldt personally invited explorers to gather data about the levelof the sea (see the case of James C Ross)

“The compilation and correlation ofmeasurements, with due attention to their distribution across vast spaces,became the major characteristic of nineteenth-century ocean science” (ToH, 275)

Rise of surveys and levelling led toincreased attention for issue of height and in developing the issue of “heightabove what?” (ToH, 276). Cites Lloyd and Colby

Reidy mentions the contemptiousness of theconcept of the level of the sea and how groups with differing interests useddifferent reference points (issue of low vs high water, link to my text ondefensive approach to the sea). R. mentions that scientists argued that nonewas a surface level, but does not give details or nores on debate. “The Britishhad a devil of a time flattening the sea.” (ToH, 276)

 

“The margin of error associated withdetermining the vertical datum point proved much greater than the margins oferror used for the land leveling and surveying techniques then used by theAdmiralty, a point previously overlooked … Only with sufficient tidal data ,reduced and analyzed , could the British government build canals and railroads, erect bridges, and survey its possessions.” (ToH, 276) 

Lubbock in his Elementary Treatise,mentions like Whewell that low and high water are ‘objectionable’ referencepoint (ET, 24 cit in ToH 276)

Reidy in his biographical entry on Lloydlinks his discovery of difference in sea levels in Panama as the ground for hisselection as the head of the Thames Levelling Commission and his elections asFellow of the Royal Soc. (but does not mention his role in development of thefirst automated tide gauges)

Did Lloyd precede Whewell?   Reidy abstracts Whewell (ToH, 277)

In his tenth series Whewell furtherdiscusses the issue (ToH, 277). As reports Reidy on the base of Whewell by thenthis had become a major project of the BAAS that had the aim to ascertain “whatsurface ought to be taken as the permanent level of the sea.” (W 10S, 151)“Whewell believed this could serve as a zero point for all surveying andtopographical work undertaken in Britain and its possessions.” (ToH 278) “Aroyal dockyard harbormaster and a Hydrographic Office computer collaboratedwith a CU professor to finally flatten the sea, and the practical implicationsshould not be missed. That Whewell first reported his results in a papercomparing Plymouth and Singapore suggested that the two places, separated bythousands of miles, had at least one thing in common: a mean tide level.” (ToH278) (see also W 9S)

This research was followed up by Airyfor  the case of Ireland (help to Colby)(ToH 278): “After this collaboration among the director of the Survey ofIreland, the astronomer royal, and the Royal Sappers and Miners, the mean sealevel became the preferred zero point for leveling operations throughout theBritish Empire.” “These same methods were then transferred across the ocean inthe last quarter of the century when the mean level of the sea became thestandard datum plane in the Survey of India. 

Cartwright notices how the idea was howevernot new, MTL having been used in 1831 as a datum by Lloyd (ST 117) Reidy citesletter from Denham to Lubbock hold at RSL archives, Lubbock Papers.

Whewell was convinced that only a globalmeasuring of tides “in the form of frequent, and simultaneous,observations”  would allow a fullunderstanding of their mechanics (Snyder 174) A William Jowett, missionary,provided Whewell with tidal data for the pacific (Snyder 175).  “The work of Lubbock, Whewell, Airy, andColby led directly to a vertical standardized datum plane, one that fit theimperial quest to standardize measurements and bring distant possessions torule.” (ToH, 280)
