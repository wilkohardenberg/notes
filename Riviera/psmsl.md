PSMSL established in 1933 to gather MSL data from around the world.

"The PSMSL was established as a “Permanent Service” of the International Council for Science in  1958, but in practice was a continuation of the Mean Sea Level Committee which had been set up at the Lisbon International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) conference in 1933" @rickards_celebrating_2015
