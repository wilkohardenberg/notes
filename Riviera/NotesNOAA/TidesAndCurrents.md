Tidal Datum convention of 1980

Tides and Currents was section of Coast and Geodetic Survey. Only early 20th century it achieved some independence and started to produce docs itself.

Negative estuaries (saltier than oceans) have special datums
River datums (Corps of Engineers), with their own datums

Steve Gill, retired chief scientist
Bruce Parker, oceanographer in NOAA for many years, does research in historical oceanography

1844 first nautical chart produced by the US used the average of two low spring tide as a datum
earliest high tabel 1866/67

first order of instruments lost

USGS Topo use MSL as datum, maybe have independent source of datum?

Datums regularly updated
Only in late 1990s T&C started to change their procedures to reflect local specificites (Texas, oil subsidence, Alaska, glacial rebound). From 20 year new datums, moved to a 5 year rolling system locally
