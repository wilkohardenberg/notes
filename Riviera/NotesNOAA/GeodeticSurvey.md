National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 was the first, used 27 tidal benchmarks on two coasts. Datum differed from perceived zero in many places due to local specificities

1981 introduction of North American Vertical Datum. Originally a joint US/Can proj, the Can pulled out because cumulative errors and computational inaccuracies intensified at the borders of network (Pacific NW for US): since most of Can pop lives along southern border they decided to stick to their 1928 Canadian datum. Diff between datums can reach tens of metres in specific localities (???).

New project, done jointly with Can again, aims at creating new datum by 2022. Uses 200 coastal stations for better averaging and aims at creating geopotential model with cm accuracy. There should be no point along coast where datum msl does not essentially coincide with perceived level of the sea. Idea is to tie vertical datum w/ geopotential model, maintaining link with idea of mean sea level and implementing oceaonographic models to determine where exactly any geoid would be at any given tide gauge.

Geoid height is the diff in height between geoid and ellipsoid.

Levelling is expensive and nobody is going to do it on great distances these days: a geopotential model of height will allow not to have to do it and be able to rely on gps, gnss, glosnast (not there yet), reaching cm level orthometric accuracy.

All these are still working on definition of an international point zero.

Roman works for a national agency, his work is tied to national dimension. However, he cooperates with various other national agencies to determine a western hemisphere geopotential datum (Can, Mex, Sirgass???)
