**207** Between 1837 and 1848 the level of the DeadSea was subject to what has been called a ‘chase’ [“The Chase After theLevel”].

 

Onlybetween 1837 and 1838 the Jordan Depression was visited by 5 expeditionsequipped with barometers.

 

Animportant role in the searches for this level was played by the ‘geo-religioussignificance of the region’: “i.e., the question of the ancient route of theJordan and the obvious possibility of its having flowed into the Red Sea.” Thechange of route was thought to be linked with the geological disaster thatannihilated Sodom and Gomorrah

DeBertou faced some difficulties in maintaining his barometer. Accuracy of hisdata was questioned by John Washington, secretary of RGS: “’he has made thepoint more complicated’” De Bertou’s data were much different from Moore’s andSvchubert’s, even if they had the same height for Jerusalem.

**216 “**After meeting him in Jerusalem in 1838,Edward Robinson became quite critical of de Bertou’s results and theirimplications. Various reasons, such as the bad relations between the Frenchmanand his Bedouin guides, this employment of an ordinary and illiterateinterpreter, and his neglect of accuracy, led to a list of points, ‘which, asit seems to me, require either confirmation or correction.’” Criticism was nota secret to RGS nor de bertou, but he rejected it.

 

**216-7 **“He admitted that he could not make use ofthe original instruments which he had brought from home, nor of thers that werelent to him. He could use his barometer on the first excursion, but ‘afterwardsthe heat melted the wax which joined the steel lock to the tube, the airentered, and I was deprived of the instrument upon which I had relied toestablish the Levels from the south of the Dead Sea to the north of theElanitic Gulf’. He was ready to give up the undertaking, but met a Frenchtraveler who ‘lent me a very good Thermometer of Levebours’

 

JosephRusseger, Austrina, made measurements in late autumn 1838, upon invite ofMehmet Ali. 

**217 **“Probably more than any other contemporarytraveler, Russegger had been well educated and equipped for his studies andmeasurements.”

**220 **In his first report  he stated that the Dead sea was 1319 Parisianfeet lower than the Med and 1349 ft lower than the Red Sea ‘reminiscent of asimilar error made by Napoleon’s surveyors, which was corrected by Chesney’.The latte altitude was later corrected to 1341 ft. ‘One of his advantages overhis predecessors was the constant re-taking of measurements at almost everylocation, so that his results coul be better and more accurately calculated,being less influenced by occasional or incidental conditions.”

“Earliestsignificant steps in the geographical, primarily cartographical, exploration ofthe Jordan Rift and the Dead Sea region, were taking during the first threedecades of the nineteenth century.” Ulrich Jasper was the pioneer: firstEuropean after the Crusader to encircle the Dead Sea.

 

**158 **It was 1837 that saw a genuine advance inthe study of the Dead Sea “when two teams, almost simultaneously and withoutknowledge of one another, determined and announced that the level of the lakewas actually lower than that of the Mediterranean.” /George H. Moore andWilliam G. Beek, surveyed the lake by boat and measured its depth.

 

**159 “**There appears also to be another remarkablefeature in the level of the sea, as from several observations about thetemperature of boiling water, it appears to be considerably lower than theocean.” In ‘On the Dead Sea and some positions in Syria’ JRGS, 7 (1837), 456.This expedition was the first one to notice the depression of the DS.

 

**203 **“The first objective of the expedition, aswritten in their letter to the RGS, was to perform ‘a trigonometric survey ofthe Dead Sea’” Produced sketches and cartography of the area.

 

**205 **“How exactly did they go about performingthe boiling-temperature measurements? The best description was given by Mooreinhis letter to the secretary of the RGS. They boiled ‘common rain water,collected from a natural reservoir in the rock’, in a tin which was intendedfor that purpose after a drawing in a pamphlet by a certain Colonel Sykes. Thethermometer was inserted as nearly to the boiling point as possible, and theexperiment was always repeated. In Jaffa an dBeirut they received exact resultsof 212F, by the DS 213F, and at Jericho a ‘somewhat superior’ result.” RGSAMoore, Geo H., RGS Correspondence 1834-40.

 

“Thesuggestion to use thermometers for hypsometric measurements had first beenraised in 1817, as the temperature of boiling water is of course dependent onthe pressure of air on the water’s surface. The problem in ht ebeginning wasthat regular thermometers could, at most, be used to establish a generaltendency, as in Moore’s and Beek’s case”. Method tudied by Colonel WH Sykes(1790-1872) Indian Army officer, Statistical Reporter btw 1824-31.

Sykeslisted the problems of existing barometers: costliness, difficult to carry,prone to accidents, risk of losing mercury. Also the new thermometric barometerwas problematic: very sensitive, fragile, not fit for rough work on the field.Sykes tested his method, always with two thermometers , on travels in Africa,Asia Minor, and India. Conversion tables allowed to translate the temperaturesin approximate heights (or depressions)

**231 **“At the beginning of the 1840s the exactaltitude of the DS level was still unclear; it would have to be determinedusing more accurate and dependable methods and instruments, starting from theMed shore, going up to Jerusalem and continuing down to the DS. A similargeographical Q, the ‘long contested point’ of the exact level of the CaspinaSea, which had been known to be lower than the Black Sea, had just beenresolved. In 1836 a Russian expedition began the trigonometric leveling, and in1838 Humboldt could already write to the RGS that the former was 94.9 Parisianfeet lower than the latter.”
