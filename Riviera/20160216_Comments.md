- Political nature of standards already clarified by Norton Wise and others
- Pay more attention to the social environments in which the story is deploying: 19th century passion for 'precision'
- Look at 'history of mistake'
- Look at more general issue of rise of sea level and embedment in ice age theory
- arbitrary? need to put material in dialogue with history of statistics
  mean as a construct
- change of purpose of measurement of MSL as way to frame narrative (floods, geodesy, anthropocene)
- need to better explain what is diplomatic in the discourse (or political?)
- use diplomacy as an analytical category
- look into legal cases about definition of coast (????)
- think about materiality of installation of tide gauge: who was needed?
- what does geographically biased distribution of tech explain
- Need to better explain technicalities, delving into history of technology
- What was reason for the construction of the first self-registering tide gauge? prize????
- larger framework: inquiry into relative measures and definition of baselines seems to connect this chapter and the last one, early geodesy and apprehensions of change
- temporal coincidence of Anthropocene and diagnostic sciencecould serve as further framework (but how???)
- there is a tension between practical aims and search for truth, with different actors. Clarify
- There was a shift in surveying tech through satellite telemetry that also might help connecting 1 and 3
- DO NOT STOP at saying they really liked standards!
- discuss what other standards have been similarly debated in frequent international meetings?
- maybe put this case in comparison with other cases of determination of baseline (low dosis)?
