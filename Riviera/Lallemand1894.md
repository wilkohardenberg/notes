Lallemand 1894

Zéro international means the the eventual unique zero to be used as a reference point for continental Europe
Zéro normal means the the current national reference points

Comptes-rendus des travaux du Groupe I (Geographie mathématique). Troisième Séance. 7 Août 1889 - geographical conference at which the issue of a point zero was discussed.

Comptes-rendus de l'Association française pour l'avancement des sciences

During previous general conference in Brussels the issue was delegated to a special commission (Hirsch, van Diesen, von Kalmár, Morsbach [the von Schmidt], Lallenmand)

The issue of an international reference point of altitude was posed the first time in 1864 at the first conference of the Erdmessung in Berlin by Hirsch. "On adopta, a cet regard, des resolutions portant que, dans chaque pays, les altitudes devaient etre rapportees a un zero normal d'une stabilite assuree." National datums had then to be compared with each other and with the maregraphic zeros through first-order levelling, as to allow the choice of a single equipotential surface for all European levellings.

General conference in Rome, 1883
Hirsch notices that the unification of heights has made little progress and that many connections between the different national reference systems are lacking. Also the data provided by the mareographes on the mean sea levels are insufficient. He also notices that the average difference between the seas of 0.72m shown by Bourdalouë's levelling between the Med and the Ocean corresponds remarkably well with that of 0.66 recorded in the Spanish levelling between Alicante and Santander. He concludesthat the reality of the difference cannot be doubted. He also asks for further research so that the international zero can be determined by the next general assembly.

Conference de Nice, 1887
During the General confernce in Berlin 1886 Lallemand draw attention on the errors that could be introduced in the results of levelling by the default of the parallelism of equipotential surfaces of the globe and the variation in the length of the rods because of temperature and humidity. HE explained how these errors had been avoided in the french Nivellement général.
To avoid the influence of such errors in Nice Hirsch and von Kalmár have the conference deliberate that, as far as possible, tide gauges are connected by levelling following the coasts as to avoid the need to reach higher altitudes.

Conference de Salzburg, 1888
For practical reasons the decision is taken thatthe zero has to be chosen among the ports of the North Sea, not belonging to a major country. According to Hirsch the decision has to be taken by the CG 1889
Lallemand notices that before taking such an important decision it would be better to go on with the research work for a few more years, since the reality of an actual difference between the seas doesn't seem demonstrated.
Bouquet de la Grye also says it would be better to wait and that actually the EMSL should be chosen in a sea with reduced impact of both tides and cyclones, like the Mediterranean [scientific localism]
General Ferrero supports the initiative but express preference for teh choice of a Mediterranean port, while Mr Faye prefers the choice of a the general mean level of the Ocean on the European coasts. Objections notwithstanding the bureau's proposal is supported unanimously.

Conference generale de Paris 1889
Lallemand communicates that according to new measurements the difference btw the med and the ocean is of just 0.2 m. The difference in respect to Bourdalouë is charged on a series of systematic levelleing errors. The difference in the Spanish levelling has to be reduced to 0.30m and that between Triest and Amsterdam, deduced from the Austrian, Prussian and Dutch levellings, to 0.18m, after they are corrected of the error caused by the normal variation of gravity with latitude.
Except rare exceptions all reference systems of different countries referred to the msl of a nearby sea. According to Lallemand for most of Europe the unification of MSL has been realised as far as practical needs request and the precision of instruments allows.

General Ibañez, reporting on mareographes, remarks that circumstances are not favourable to resolve the issue of the international zero and demands to postpone the sollution of three more years. Discussing this request Ferrero and Faye state that it woudl have been faster and easier if a point in the middle of the continent had been chosen as international zero, rather than one along the coasts.

Bouquet de la Grye instead claims that the general surface of comparison of heights needs to coincide with the surface of a tranquil sea.

Fribourg 1890
Lallemand's report confirms that the diff is of just 10-20 cm, following detailed analysis of difference between different points of the Europena coasts.. Such a diff is in the order of magnitude of the levelling errors.
It is thus plausible that the height of the sea is the same all around the continent. LAllemand conlcudes that the adhering countries may choose as datum the MSL in a fixed point along their coasts: The unification of heights will thus be obtained without challenging any national pride and without recurring to the difficult and delicate undertaking of a general compensation of the levelling networks.
For scientific needs the Association will publish regularly the relationships between the different networks.
von Kalmar states that he as well has determined the uniformity of MSL

Florence 1891
The report of the central bureau presented by Helmert in Florence shows, among different hypotheses, the results of a general compensation of a levelling network covering most of central and western Europe. Helmert reaches more or less the same conclusions of Lallemand and states that it is necessary to renounce the idea of a single zero of heights for the whole of Europe. It will be enough to recommend that heights are always related to the msl in points recognised or presumed to be stable of the European littoral.
The central burau will continue publishing, in accord with the progress of maregraphic measurements to calculate the relationship between the normal zeroes of different countries.
Helmert also supports, as a personal opinion, Bouquet de la Grye's (ingenieur hydrographe en chef de la marine) idea that because of the movements of the earth's crust the normal zeroes need to remain in strict relationship with the MSL. Hirsh objects that the differences in altitude of the seas are but a secondary aspect and that the choice of an international zero is recommended in particular by the need to end the current situation in which the reference point can vary of various meters passing a border. Hirsch asks the central bureau to answer the follwoing Qs:

1. which are the relative heights of the current normal zeroes and how precisely are those linked to the closest MSL?
2. produce a table of heights of MSLs of different seas and provide the probable degree of precision of each coast. For the gauges that are close to each other the idfference in MSL following a directeleveling along the coasts shall be provided (Hirsch-von Kalmár 1887)
3. which are, according to these results the seas and coast with teh stablest msl?

Proposal is adopted

BRuxelles 1892
Answers of the central buraeu
1. the heights of the only two normal zeroes not sitatuted along a coast (Pierre du Niton and Normalnull) can be set, with an approx of respectivel 6 and 4 cm, in relationship with MSL of the closest seas
2. the differences in height of MSLs among points of the same coast and connected by direct levelling are
  * 8cm on the Baltica
  * 18cm on the North Sea
  * 27cm on the English Channel
  * 33cm on the Atlantic
  * 12cm on the Med
  * 17cm on the Adria
3. None of these seas presents thus a uniform level, and the differences along one coast reache the same magnitude as those among different coasts.

In relation to the relative stability of coasts and seas the observations made until now are still insufficient to allow to formulate at this regard a certain opinion.
The Bureau sticks thus to the idea that an international should not further be looked for. If each country took as a normal zero the MSL in a point along its coasts teh difference at borders would not be more than 20-30 cm. the adoption of a single zero would not forbid the existence of similar differences at junction points not included in the general compensation.
"Vouloir à tout prix éliminer ces discordances une fois pour toutes, serait mettre une barrière à la marche du progrès"(130)
Furthermore countries like the Netherlands and Germany who succeded with grea effort to unify their hypsometric networks would difficult abandon their chart datums to adopt an international zero of doubtful usefulness.

General Annibale Ferrero observes that the report of the Bureau only looks at the geometric side of the problem and that it looks like the geological and practical conditions an international datum would have to fulfill had not been researched as well as European localities that would satisfy this condition. He states it would be an indignity for the Ass to abandon after twenty years of research a problem whose solution is impatiently awaited by various countries. He proposes to further the research in a special commission.

Hirsch, supporting this motion, says that the argument of the accummulation of errors along long levelling lines moved against the choice of a single datum could also be moved against the datums of of very large countries such as Germany between Metz and Königsberg and Austria-Hungary between Bregenz and Klausenburg (Cluj). The idea of modifications to the datum in the future also cannot be a reason enough to renounce this choice. "Enfin il serait regrettable que des compétitions d'amours-propres nationaux empêchassent la réalisation d'une mesure de progrès" As a compromise Hirsch would accept as general surface of comparison the average level of the seas touching Europe. To determine this level a stable point at the center of the continent and possibly in a neutral country should be chosen whose height in respect to different datums should be measured: the average of these heights would than be taken as the height of the chosen point. http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/people/data?id=per327 [obviously it is the representative of Switzerland who proposes that just what sounds awfully similar to the Swiss Pierre du Niton is chosen as international datum]

Helmert claims that the insufficent precision of current levellings would not allow to calculate with enough precision the general MSL of the European seas. On the other hand he would find it unaccpetable that a measure recommended by the ASs would not be followed upon. He also claims, that by then there was not a single European country interested in the subject.

Adopting Ferrero's proposal, supported by Hirsch and accepted by Helmert the BRuxelles conference adjourned further three years the solution of the intenrational datum issue. Commission made up by Hirsch, von Kalmár, van Diesen, Morsbach and Lallemand.
1. What conditions should an international datum fulfill?
2. Which European localities would be better apt?

Works of the Commission du Zero International des altitudes
Met on 14 Sept 1893.

von Kalmár
  1. Conditions to be fulfilled
    a. Absolute invariability in time and space: Geophysical researches have shown that most Europen seas are modified over time to an extent that canot yet be precisely determined, because of the insufficient observations done.
    b. possibly as central as possible position within Europe: levelling combined with data from gauges must allow to determine and measure the centennial elevations and subsidence of the soil inland. levelling between geologically relevant locations has thus to be repeated every 10 years. As to make it possible for these movements to be accounted the international datume does not be affected by these. It would thus be dangerous to chose an inland location as international datum.
    c. possibility to connect it with the datums of different countries: its position is not relevant to this
  2. Best place is not yet possible to determine with current data. Even determining the probable level surface that could be used by all countries, the desired harmony would not be reached at borders if not for the levelling lines considered in producing the average.
  Kalmar proposes that the levelling networks of all European countries should be put in rel with one single comparison surface, the mean level surface of the European seas. this surface shall be fixed in different countires to one or more reference points.
  Determining scientifically this surface will not be possible for various years after a repeated verification of adjoining levellings and after observations of sea levels has been prolonged for more time.

According to van Diesen international datum does not need to correspond to MSL in a specific point, but would best be determined not by a single reference point, but by various stable RPs, easily accessible  and positioned in placese not subject to elevations and subsidence or earthquakes. These RPs would have to be connected to well chosen tide gauges.

von Schmidt objected to this proposal. the impossible to avoid anomalies btween relative heights of different chosen RPs would need to be eliminated through a partial compensation, by which one of these RPs would need to be selected as more fundamental than others.

Lallemand states that a similar critique could be moved to von Kalmar's proposal: even using the community of all RPs as a RP, over time would lead to the need to select one over the others as actual RP. The only solution he claims is to use in each country the closes MSL. Seas having all more or less the same altitude the unification would be reached on its own, without the intervetnion of an arbitrary compensation.
