The 1954 data are taken from the answers sent by the local forestry districts to the Trentino forestry service for a survey of eagles in the Province, co-organised with the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche.

It is always difficult to geolocate precisely historical documents. The data given in 1954, given only with place names and no coordinates, referred in many cases to obsolete toponyms or had errors. I have attempted to geolocate them as precisely as possible using an array of web sources: http://www.geonames.org
