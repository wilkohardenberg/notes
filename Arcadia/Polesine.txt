The great fear. The Polesine flood of 1951
**Article: engaging text on an interesting/important environmental topic, max. 300 words**
One of the biggest Italian natural disasters triggered by the climatic conditions was probably the Polesine flood of November 1951. Following a rainy season there had been a progressive increase of the river Po's height, and even if the levees broke in various points long its course, it had not been enough to reduce the waterflow significantly. Moreover, getting nearer to the rivermouth the distance between the dykes diminished, increasing the speed of the wave. The flood wave reached thus the Polesine, near the river's delta, at its zenith and submerged hundreds of hectares of agricultural land lying below sea level, killing 84 people and leaving 180.000 people homeless.
But, beyond simplistic and fatalistic meteorological answers given right after the event, the disaster had also deeper reasons, such as the lack of a coherent planning policy aimed at organising flood defences in the whole Po riverbasin. In particular, huge investments would have been needed to improve the conditions of the Po's right tributaries, made dangerous by the state of abandonment of their basins and by the high degree of erosion caused by enduring deforestation processes. Moreover, the maintenance of the levees had been poorly  performed and the reduction of the river's gradient caused by the continued deposition of detritus in the delta had increased the risk of storm surges. All these risks had been clearly stated by the experts way before the Polesine flood, but the Italian state reacted late and ineffecively.
However, the attempts made by the communist opposition to claim for human responsibilities were called subversive and unhuman. The state refused to bear any responsibility for the damages caused by natural disasters, preferring to start an anti-communist witch-hunt, rather than engage in actual efforts for an improvement of soil conservation.

In November 1951 the Polesine was hit by a massive flood, that submerged hundreds of hectares and left tens of thousands of people homeless. Beside a particularly rainy season the event was caused also by an enduring lack in flood defence policies.
