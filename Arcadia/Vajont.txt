Expecting the disaster. The landslide of the Vajont dam.

On October 9, 1963, at 10:39 pm 260 million cubic metres of rock detached from the top of Monte Toc, on the border between Veneto and Friuli Venezia Giulia, and glided into the reservoir of the Vajont Dam, producing an enormous wave of at least 50 million cubic metres of water. The dam, completed in 1959 and one of the biggest in the world at the time, did not suffer any serious damage but the overtopping water wiped out several villages in the valley and killed almost 2,000 people. A third of the population of Longarone, the greatest village downstream of the dam, was killed on this occasion. 
Immediately the disaster became a topic of political struggle in the mediascape. Conservative newspapers depicted the event as merely natural and completely unavoidable event: the message was that the dam and its builders had no responsibilities since it had resisted the impact of the landslide. On the other hand opposition newspapers hinted to the fact that the disaster could have been avoided and that it was mainly caused by human carelessness. 
The dam, considered to be at the forefront of technical expertise, had however been built without considering worrying geological reports, possible tectonic problems, local knowledge and Monte Toc's connaturate instability: already in 1960, just after the end of the building works, small landslides had been experienced. The fear that Monte Toc could collapse was common in the area. Moreover, the builders and managers had been guiltily inattentive to soil conservation and had filled the reservoir way over the security level. The reasons of technical expertise and of finance and a blind faith in development had had the overhand in respect to a real consideration of the environmental conditions of the valley and to care for human lives.
