A sanctuary for the ibex: the Gran Paradiso from Royal hunting reserve to national park
**Article: engaging text on an interesting/important environmental topic, max. 300 words**
The Gran Paradiso area has historically been at the core of the attempts made by the Piedmontese Royal house to preserve the ibex (Capra ibex). By 1821 the Piedmontese state had forbidden ibex hunting. Nonetheless, poaching went on almost undisturbed on the Gran Paradiso massif, and between 1850 and 1856 King Vittorio Emanuele II decided to establish there a royal hunting reserve, based on a complex system of tenancies with private landowners. This act saved Alpine ibex from extinction: all current ibex populations in the Alps, in fact, stem from this original stock. 
In September 1919 King Vittorio Emanuele III offered to donate the hunting reserve to the Italian state. The creation of a national park was however delayed until the end of 1922, when the new Fascist regime decided, as an act of propaganda, to support its institution as the first Italian national park. This delay transformed the former hunting reserve into a sort of no-man’s-land, a veritable paradise for poachers. Ibex and chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) hunters, dressed in military outfit and armed with machine guns, were a common sight within the park before 1922. 
Moreover, the institution of the park raised a number of ongoing conflicts with the local communities entitled to hunting rights outside the King’s former private properties. These rights, in fact, were dismissed without right for compensation. Further conflicts took place between those planning a park aimed at the promotion of mountain tourism following the so-called American model and those supporting the institution of a veritable "ibex sanctuary", a park aimed at pure conservation and scientific research following the Swiss model. In the end the Gran Paradiso National Park was set up as a compromise solution, where tourism and conservation could somehow coexist.

Since the 19th century the Italian Royal house has been active in the preservation of the Alpine ibex. The Gran Paradiso, first as a hunting reserve and then as a national park, has thus long been the last refuge in the Alps for this iconic animal.
