No Nuke! The afthermath of Chernobyl in Italy and the antinuclear referendum of 1987
**Article: engaging text on an interesting/important environmental topic, max. 300 words**
The antinuclear referendum held on November 8-9, 1987 represents one of the rare political victories of the Italian environmental movement. Organised immediately after the Chernobyl disaster of April 26, 1986 by a wide spectrum of forces, including various environmentalist associations, the green party, the Communist youth organisation and other leftist parties, it led to a still enduring moratorium on the building of nuclear plants in Italy. About 65% of the voters took part in the referendum, and about 80% of these voted in favour of the abolition of a few norms regulating the localization of new nuclear plants. The moral suasion effect of such a clear electoral result induced the government to block the construction even of those nuclear plants whose projects had already been approved and to stop also working plants.
Attempts had been made to call for an antinuclear referendum already at the end of the 1970s, in particular by the small but combative Radical Party, but only the widespread popular fear of the radioactive cloud produced by the explosion of one of Chernobyl's reactors produced the needed political monumentum. The shock effect caused by the incident as regards all issues related to nuclear power security led even two major parties, traditionally in favour of nuclear power, such as the Socialist Party (part of the government coalition) and the Communist Party (opposition) to back the antinuclear referendum campaign. Even the leading governmental party, the Christian Democrats, out of fear to to loose also votes at the political elections, left its supporters freedom of conscience.
It may be said that popular excitement following Chernobyl induced most Italian political parties to abandon their attempts, pursued for years, to rationalise risks and benefits of nuclear power production in favour of immediate political returns.
