Fascism tried to symbolize a //New Italy// through the attempt to transform wild nature into productive nature. This effort was intended to represent physically the civilizing value that Fascist ideology assigned to agriculture.    
From the symbolic point of view the most important integral land-reclamation (//bonifica integrale//) project was the one that started in the Pontine marshes in the 1920s. In a huge effort the ponds were drained, the glades filled, the woods cut, new towns founded, settlers moved from all over the country. The regime claimed to have eradicated malaria in the region, but in the process it also destroyed many precious wetland ecosystems.
The creation in 1934 of the Parco Nazionale del Circeo (Circeo National Park) came as a side effect of this  environmentally ruinous reclamation programme. Only 3,270 out of the original 20,700 hectares of forests and swamps were put under protection as a reminder of how the region supposedly looked during the Roman Empire, including archaelogical remains and water buffaloes as symbols of an alleged lost rural greatness, and for the aims of propaganda. Moreover, 700 hectares were reforested with alien species, such as eucalyptus, as to recreate the windbreak effect formerly caused by the Mediterranean maquis and disrupted during the reclamation works.
The nature of the park was, thus, an artefact, just as the rest of the Pontine Marshes subject to the //bonifica integrale//.   The park was even advertised as the new wood reservoir of the capital, a possible source of wood and work in the winter season for the new settlers of the Pontine marshes, and a nearby and healthy tourist destination for town-dwellers. The natural landscape was, for the Fascist regime, beautiful, healthy, worthy of protection only in reason of human work and of its utilitarian value.
