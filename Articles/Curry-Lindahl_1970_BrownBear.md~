Destruction of forests and heavy hunting pressure has forced it to retreat to forest-clad mountains in various parts of Europe (13-20 insular bear pops in Europe)

1922 30 bears in Abruzzo, 1935 more than 200 1964 60 bears, 1971 70-100 bears

"Of the large European carnivores--the bear, the wolf, and the lynx--only the bear has survived in the Alps with about 8-10 animals in the Italian Dolomites."

"The grand total of European brown bear populations seems to be approximately 17.700- 18,000 animals"

1925 total protection of Swedish bear pop

2 months hunting season reintroduced in Sweden in 1943

Inhabitant of forests all over Europe, "although it makes visit above the timberline in spring to feed on carrion ... and in late summer and autumn to feed on berries."

optimal habitats coniferous, mixed and deciduous forests, with rich under-vegetation of vascular plants.

In most Europe bears are found in coniferous forests despite that deciduous forests seem to be more apt.

"If left in peace, the brown bear will stay within a certain large territory; if often disturbed, it may roam over tremenduous areas. Usually it lives alone, although the females remain with their young upt to a year and a half. During the summer it si chiefly active during the afternoons and the evenings."

"Just before or just after the first snow has fallen in the autumn, the borwn bear retreats to a den, whihc has been prepared in advance. the den is in a natural cave, a dug cavty in the earth of a slope, an anthill ..., under a fallen tree, under low overhanging brnches, between or under large roots and under overhanging rocks. ... the same den can be used for several years."

"There is doubtless a small drop of temperature in the brown bear during hibernation, although it does not prevent a winter sleeping bear from becoming immediately active when disturbed."

"The European brown bear is omnivorous, but feeds chiefly on plants. In summer it eats mostly grass, herbs, fruit, berries and roots." "The brown bear also relishes ants, honey, beeswax, insect larvae, small rodents, fish and carrion"
"Only exceptioally do brown bear acquire a taste for fresh meat and attack large mammals such as moose _Alces alces_, reindeer, red deer _Cervus elaphus_ and livestock."

Reproduction pattern: copulation in may june, gestation of 6-7 months the 1-3(4) cubs are born in the den in December January. Regularly suckled up to June-July and irregularly up to an age of 1 and a half. Female usually has cubs every second year.. Sexual maturity at 2 and half / 4 years. Max longevity n captivity 47 years.

"The European brown bear is not dangerous to man unless it is attacked and wounded or its young are threatened or believed to be so." Does not share reputation of aggressiveness of Hokkaido bear and grizzlies.

"Although the brown bear lives in many areas where there are livestock grazing extensively in the same habitats, it does not normally kill domestic animals. There are observations of brown bears feeding on meadows where cattle were grazing without any reactions from either the bear or the herbivores. A sizable bear population haunts the Caucasus Mountains--often in the middle of the sheep- breeding regions--apparently without coming into conflict with human interests. In one place in the Caucasus shepherds pointed out to me a cave in a mountain-side where a bear was resting; neither the sheep grazing all around nor the shepherds seemed unduly concerned. In Swedish Lapland domestic reindeer and bears meet frequently. The former are normally undisturbed when a bear is in the vincinity, but when the reindeer females are giving birth or are accompanied by newborn calves, they are alert to the presence of bears. In Swedish Lapland some bears--apparently the same individuals and perhaps their offspring--regularly every spring visit areas where reindeer females give birth. Many calves are stillborn or succumb just after birth, so this may be the prime reason for the bear's interest during a season when vegetable food on which the bear likes to feed is almost non-existent."

"Also elsewhere in Europe bears in some areas in late winter or early spring are forced to feed on carrion or live mammals. In such cases sheep and other domestic animals may fall victim to them, but in general such cases are quite exceptional".

"The brown bear is not endangered by extinction in Europe, but its range is shrinking due to habitat alterations. Hunting pressure has ceased and the species is at present totally or seasonally protected in most countries. In many areas it is showing a gradual adaptation to cultivated habitats. It is certainly able to live side by side with man without causing serious conflicts"
