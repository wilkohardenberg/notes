Sheep that were locked into barns or corrals at night were usually safe against wolf and lynx predation but could still suffer bear predation. This seemed to be rare, but if bears succeeded in breaking into barns or corrals, they often caused considerable damage because the sheep panicked and suffocated from crowding. 66-67

Today the distribution of lynx, wolves, and bears in Europe is tightly linked to forest cover, and all 3 predators are rarely present in open country  where they are vulnerbale to human persecution. Therefore, livestock are most vulnerable  in or near the forest. 67

In the Alps, natural losses -- not attributed to predators -- were estimated at 3-5% for untended sheep. 67
