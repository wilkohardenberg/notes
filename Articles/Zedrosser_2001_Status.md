"Later the species disappeared from most areas as the human population grew and suitable habitat was destroyed by deforestation and agriculture. In addition, the extermina- tion of bears was often encouraged as a means of elimi- nating livestock depredation, with bounties paid by the state, local authorities, or both, for killing bears. This was effective because bears have a low reproductive rate and are sensitive to high harvest rates. Eventually, the combi- nation of human persecution and habitat destruction led to the extermination of bears from most of western Eu- rope and many areas in eastern and northern Europe (Swenson et al. 1995, Rauer and Gutleb 1997, Breitenmoser 1998)."

potential bear habitats in SA 1,500 sqkm, of which only 240 sqkm used regularly by bears. Reproduction not documented since 1989. 4 bears left in 1999

"In addition to legal hunting, bears are poached as nuisance bears, for trophies, or for economic reasons."

"The effective guarding techniques necessary for coex- istence of livestock husbandry and large carnivores have vanished in many areas of Europe (Kaczensky 1996); partly due to economic, social, and political changes, and partly as a result of the extermination of large carnivores in most of their former ranges. For this reason, damage to livestock occurs in many areas where the bear range in- cludes human settlements. In addition, bears damage oats, orchards, and beehives in some areas. There is compen- sation for damage in most countries (64%), either by the national or regional government (57%) or hunter clubs (21%, Table 5). In Slovakia and Austria, damage is com- pensated by either national or regional governments, or by hunters. Usually compensation is not linked to the owner's effort to prevent damage. In 1995-96 about US$ 1.15 million was paid to compensate for bear damage throughout Europe. The vast majority of livestock lost to bear depredation in Europe are sheep (Table 5). In Finland, Norway, and Sweden, semi-domestic reindeer depredation is also sig\[nificant. Damage
to beehives is
only important
in a few countries, with Greece experiencing the most
cases of damage\]".

Difference in pop among European areas prob due to attitudes of people and differing historical and economic dev of areas.

"We believe that communism in Eastern Europea was not nearly as destructive to bear population as the political systems in western Europe. This is possibly due to the fact that in communist countries, bears were often managed for the hunting purpose of a few hunters, including foreign hunters with hard currency. Also, hunting and gun-ownership among the general public were strictly limited, thus reducing the potential for over hunting and poaching"

"It may be easier to recover large carnivore popilations when the population has not been absent for many decades (Boitani 1995). But if reintroduction is chosen, great care has to be taken in the preparation of the project and solutions for possible problems must be available in advance."
