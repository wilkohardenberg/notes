> Contrary to males, that may cover large distances during dispersal, females seem to settle largely in or adjacent to their natal range and therefore population expansion for females is much slower than for males (taberlet et al 1995; Knauer 2000)

> The expansion of brown bears in Austria is a great challenge for wildlife managers and conservation biologists because they envisage a viable population, while reducing the conflicts that the species may generate to a minimum.

> However, the population dynamics of brown bears in Austria are complex, because the key ecological processes operate on different spatial scales(involving the scales of an individual home range, a subpopulation, and the entire eastern Alps), and the habitat is fragmented and the population is unevenly distributed. Additionally, due to the secretive behaviour of brown bears and their low numbers, the information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of the Austrian population is scarce and uncertain.

> To model variable home range sizes we select a resolution that is finer than the typical scale of a home range and choose an intermediate 10 km × 10 km raster size as the spatial subunit for our model. With this scale we cover the eastern Alps (≈120,000 km 2 ) with a grid comprising 36 × 54 cells. We define a square of nine cells (≈900 km 2 ) as the maximum size of a female’s home range, and a square of 36 cells (≈3600 km 2 ) as the maximum size of a male’s home range. These maximum sizes accord qualitatively with observations of telemetric studies in Austria (Rauer and Gutleb 1997) or Scandinavia (Wabakken et al. 1992), but are larger than bear home ranges in the core area in Slovenia (Kaczensky 2000a, b).

> Densely populated valleys and highways without many bridges or tunnels are spatial barriers that influence the spatial pattern of the expansion. Studies conducted in Slovenia showed that a highway poses a significant mortality risk

> and is a barrier that is rarely crossed by resident bears, but may be crossed by dispersing subadult bears (Kaczensky et al. 1996; Kaczensky 2000a, b). None of the resident bears had a home range crossed by a highway (Kaczensky et al. 1996). In the eastern Alps, highways are expected to be a minor problem because there are more bridges and tunnels.

> After independence from the mother, subadults disperse and search for their own home range. During 1 year, they are allowed to perform up to S max
site-sampling steps. They move one grid cell per step, selecting a neighbouring cell at random (Knauer 2000; Kaczensky 2000b) with a probability
that is directly proportional to the attractiveness of the cell, relative to that of the other neighbouring cells. Dispersal of females continues until they encounter a home range, or until the maximum number of site-sampling steps is reached. By contrast, males accept a home range only with a probability that increases linearly with the number s of site-selecting steps already performed.

88
> Only resident females that are not accompanied by a litter and with a home range near a male home range can reproduce. Proximity of males is defined as a distance of <7 cells between the centre of the female home range and one cell of the male home range. This allows males excursions up to 60 km, which is the maximal width of a male home range.

> Individuals with larger home ranges have to move more compared to individuals with smaller home ranges and may thus carry a higher risk of mortality.

91
> In four verified (and one probable) cases the breeding interval was 2 years, and in one verified (and one probable) case females had their first litters at age 3 years. These data indicate high reproductive parameters. Similar observations were made in expanding populations in Scandinavia (e.g., Bjärvall et al. 1990; Sæther et al. 1998; Swenson et al. 2000). In Scandinavia, the majority of females come out with a litter the spring after family breakup (J. Swenson, personal communication)

> The average distance between the mother home range and the own home range for males averages in our model was 120 km, with 5% of them dispersing more than 240 km (Table 2). This distance is about the distance between the core area and the area where bears were released in central Austria (Figure 1). In contrast to males, females dispersed less (Table 2). The mean female dispersal distance in our model was some 46 km, and 5% of all females moved more than 110 km. In comparison with data from Scandinavia, this estimate seems to be too high. In Scandinavia, where the home range sizes are similar to those in the Alps, the mean maximum dispersal distance was 29 km (n = 11) and the 95%-percentile 34 km (Taberlet et al. 1995).

109
> Because of its low numbers and apparently high female mortality rates, the small bear population of Austria is currently far from being viable.

110
> The available data on age of first reproduction and the interbirth interval from the subpopulation in central Austria indicate a high reproductive potential similar to the populations in northern Spain (Wiegand et al. 1998) and Scandinavia (Sæther et al. 1998). However, the good conditions for reproduction are contrasted with apparently high mortality rates, which indicate a high human impact on the population. This situation is typical for large carnivores where deaths are mainly caused by humans (e.g., Woodroffe and Ginsberg 1998), whereas nutritional condition determines the reproductive rate. As a consequence, a poorly perceived high risk of human-caused mortality in otherwise good habitats (where resources are abundant and reproductive potential could be high) may create attractive sinks (Delibes et al. 2001). Therefore an analysis of factors influencing reproduction and (human-caused) mortality would be important to identify and manage possible attractive sinks and to reduce the high mortality.

> This isolation makes the subpopulation in central Austria even more vulnerable to chance events due to demographic stochasticity. Since an increase of landscape connectivity is not possible on such large scales and because the possibility of further reintroduction has been strongly opposed, a reduction of the high mortality rates forms the principal management target.
