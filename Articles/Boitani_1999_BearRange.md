> Brown bear populations in European countries are drastically reduced from earlier sizes, with populations ranging as low as 4-5 up to 80-100 bears (IRSNB 1992)

Majority highly isolated and in need of conservation

> Bears in the Eastern Alps survive in 2 small, isolated populations: 3-4 individuals in the Adamello-Brenta Natural Park, considered a relict population unable to reproduce since 1989 (Osti 1994)

Need to consider spatially explicit models of habitat suitability and sustainable development (Ciucci and Boitani 1996)

> Bears live at low densities and have large home ranges, thus any conservation strategy should have a broad scale approache to accomodate viability requirements (Paquet and Hackman 1995). Because spatial requirements are evaluated in terms of availability, localization, and configuration of suitable areas with respect to a human dominated land matrix, it is unlikely that available remnants of wilderness are large enough to accommodate viable bear populations. Rather, a network of protected (or appropriately managed) areas has been viewed as an alternative solution to meet viability requirements for large carnivores (Noss and Harris 1986). Such a system should be centered on critical areas of suitable environments connected through corridors and should be integrated into a human-dominated matrix which includes transitional areas (i.e., buffer zones) devoted to sustainable use. Furthermore, any local conservation measure (e.g., establishing a protected area) or management intervention
(e.g., incentives for fruit tree plantations or alternative livestock husbandry), to be effectively implemented and monitored at the administrative level, needs to be planned within a broader land-use policy articulated through geographically explicit guidelines.

> If the present conditions are not changed, it is quite unlikely that immigration from the east could ever reach the relict Adamello-Brenta bear population in zone C.

> Among large carnivores, the brown bear represents one of the greatest challenges for conservationists. Biological characteristics such as long generation time, low juvenile proportion in the population, sensitivity to low mortality levels, low density and extensive spatial requirements, reduced dispersion capabilities, high habitat selectivity and seasonal requirements, and large foraging needs all interact to cause the brown bear to be a species of low resilience (Weaver et al. 1996). This characterization could be particularly true in alpine regions, where environmental instability is greatest and natural barriers to dispersion are more frequent. However, the conservation value of the bear is enhanced by its role both as an umbrella (Soule 1987) and flag species (Noss et al. 1996). Bear conservation, especially in highly populated countries such as Italy, therefore needs to be rigorously planned to promote viability, but at the same time, to allow a functional coexistence with human land-uses. A bear conservation strategy based on land-use planning requires a large-scale approach and a concerted effort addressing all the different aspects of bear conservation.

> Construction of roads, mining, logging, presence of highways and railways, excessive tourism, livestock grazing, and hunting are all activities
which, if undertaken at critical places or seasons, may drastically affect environmental quality for the bears. On a local scale, environmental degradation and fragmentation may disrupt the connectivity among areas required by bears on a seasonal basis (e.g., foraging and wintering territories). Similar environmental change on a larger scale may lead to an increasing fragmentation of the suitable habitat at the regional level, thus leading to a decrease in viability of the population.

> Individually, the different zones are not large enough to support a self-sustaining bear population in the long term. Instead, if
connectivity within the 10,850 km2 of suitable environments were ensured, a population of 100-300 bears might be achieved. Although not viable in the long term, this population may represent a realistic goal for a conservation program for the brown bear in the Eastern Alps of Italy. Prospects are even more encouraging if, as already planned, the brown bear conservation program is integrated in the near future at the international level.

> Second, the establishment of the existing protected areas most often reflects scenic and landscape criteria rather than wildlife spatial and habitat requirements. The result in the Eastern Alps is that most protected lands are distributed at the higher elevations and do not include produc\[tive, seasonally important areas for the bear\].

> Instead, these productive seasonally important areas are located at low-medium elevations where fragmentation and disturbance by man is higher. Third, protected areas are most often planned locally and independently; their relative distribution and configuration (including connectivity) has not evolved considering large carnivore conservation.
