467: hibernation is the appropriate term for the bear's dormant or tepid state during denning

"the most refined response to starvation of any mammal"

"7 months without eating, drinking, defecating, or urinating"

Watts e al 1981 (121) defined mammalian hibernation as a "specialized seasonal reduction of metabolism concurrent with the environmental pressures of food inavailability and low environmental temperatures"

article focusses on Ursus americanus

"Black bears hibernate at or near normal body temperature, in contrast to the true hibernators, which hibernate with a body temperature near ambient, approaching but not falling below 0C"

Resting heart rate drops from 40 bpm to 8-10 bpm

"Metabolic rate of the 3 NA bears during hibernation averaged 68, 68 and 73% of predicted basal metabolic rate for brown (U.arctos), black and polar bears, respectively."

weight losses range between 15% and 27% of predenning body weight in captive bears, 16 to 37 in wild bears.

Loss of mass was over 50% higher for bears that abandoned dens due to disturbance than for undistrubed bears.

10-20% muscle fiber atrophy

"ability of ursids to conserve body protein is not absolute, but rather depends on the degree of fat storage at the initiation of the hibernating fast."
