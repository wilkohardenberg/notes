Following on Buller's tracks in this paper I look at biosecurity (a concept increasingly used among social and natural scientists \[Collier\]) from the "visceral" perspective of "not being eaten by big and ferocious wild animals". What obviously is also part of this interpretation is the need within human societies to protect property from damages caused by these same animals.

Reintroductions as an issue of "conflicting and competing 'philosophies of nature'" (Thompson, 2002)

> These, wittingly or unwittingly, throw more traditional biosecurity concerns back onto the political and social agenda and thereby problematise the socionatural accommodations that have developed and been actively constructed in their place by both humans and nonhumans.

> explore how this problematisation takes place, how it impacts upon spatial practice, and how it reawakens and challenges the categorisations and constructions of both 'bio' (as 'life' but also as 'nature') and 'security' (as physical 'safety' but also perhaps as ontological well-being).

> I want to look at how the management of this form of biosecurity, intertwined as it has become with competing considerations of biodiversity and a renewed accounting of the `wild', has necessitated a move away from the traditional mechanisms of spatial distanciation and exclusion, to a new, but challenging and troubled, rhetoric and dispositive of association, relation, and integration.

Threat to life and goods vs threat to survival of the bear as opposing 'philosophies of nature'

> Yet, being attacked or killed by the `big bad wolf', though it is no longer an everyday threat to most of us, has remained a consistently powerful story for humanity's self-positioning with respect to the nonhuman and to nature. The wolf has long held an iconic status, largely as a powerful, savage, and menacing natural otherness

>  A third dimension to this relational context lies in the long-standing tendency, evoked by Thomas (1991), to see in each species some socially relevant `human' quality with which to categorise ourselves. In this manner, wild beasts and wolves, in particular, have come to embody a variety of (human) evils, both social and political, including sexual predation, vagrancy, and marginality

> Of course, it has been the development of animal husbandry that has provided the most effective rationale for the demonisation, exclusion, and, following Bennett (2001), disenchantment of the wolf. If the wolf held paradigmatic status for hunting peoples, it has become the _enemi sans pareil_ for shepherds and farmers across the Earth, the symbol of the predatory wild as a threat to the acquiescent, and defenseless, tamed. Countless societies subsequently measured that threat in real terms, not only because such animals do us actual harm--or are considered a risk in this sense--but also because they prey upon the animals that we give value to--namely, the flocks and herds of husbandry

1586

> Historically, therefore, within Western Europe, `security' from the particular and primordial biothreat of wild, predatory animals has been achieved by the relatively simple expediency of removing the predatory species. This has provided the moral justification for their extermination and removal from the managed agrorural spaces of human civilisation. Indeed, it continues to do so as we shall see further on. Charged, both economically and morally with the well-being of their herds, and increasingly legally through contemporary farm animal welfare legislation, farmers and shepherds claim legitimacy in the hunting and killing of a multitude of wild predators for reasons of animal safety. **Thus, the wolves, like the bears of Western Europe, were eradicated, hunted out, and driven back by the removal of their habitat.**

>  As George (2007) points out: "habituated wildlife is always more dangerous to humans than wildlife that is naturally wary of humans." Their renewed spatial proximity thereby brings with it a renewed threat to human biosecurity, one derived from the renegotiation of their 'wild' status

> Having been subjected to centuries of expulsion and slaughter as the natural embodiment of physical threat, darker evil, and risk, particularly during the modernist age of the 19th and early 20th centuries, wolves, in an almost ontological volte face, were gradually requalified and reinstated as a threatened and thereby protected species during the second half of the 20th century especially in Europe and North America. The risk of attack and predation was substituted by a new risk, that of species disappearance and extinction. Such a reversal of fortunes reveals much both about the changing context of human relations with wild nature and about the wolf itself as a key species in that revalued wild.

Coleman (2004, 203) "sympathetic constituency"

In contrast to Buller I look not at the migration process leading wolves to reoccupy territories, nor at the reintroduction process as depicted above, but rather at the reframing of biosecurity and biodiversity over time around a historically existing and threatened colony of bear.

> In other areas and in other parts of the world, however, the process of recolonisation, it is claimed, has been more `natural', with wolves regaining, through active migration, territories from which they were once excluded. It is this second process which interests us here in this paper, for accompanying the wolves in this migration is a series of philosophical positions with respect to issues of wild nature and naturality, but also threat and security, that overtly conflict with and challenge the sometimes carefully constructed philosophies of nutured, yet distinct, nature and management that have, over the last thirty or so years, been developed as surrogates and simulacra for a lost, and, indeed, largely unacceptable, wild. Hence, the wolves that are walking back into a landscape are doing so less as predators on still-present livestock but, rather, as symbolic heralds of a newly reinvigored naturality, one in which the competing rhetorics of biosecurity and biodiversity curiously intertwine.

The role of pastoralism in the economy of Trentino?

What does the bear represent?

1590

> If support for the wolf's gradual recolonisation of the French Alps has been almost universally couched in terms of its ecological contribution to
biodiversity, those who oppose the wolves's reintroduction, principally the sheep farmers and the hunters, have mobilised the argument of biosecurity: the security of their sheep flocks, their own personal security and that of local people, the security of the varied fauna that is hunted and that coexists with upland sheep farming and, ultimately, the security of the Alpine pastoral economy

1591

> Nevertheless, the threat is always there as a potential. In recent years, that potential has yielded monetary value. For local political leaders, the presence of the wolves is seen as of positive economic benefit through increased local tourism.

> For their supporters in the Mercantour, therefore, the wolves constitute an acceptable, even welcome, biothreat for such a peril is taken as an integral component of the reinstated naturality that the wolves represent. For its opponents, the wolf is a dangerous, nonhuman predator that does not belong. What is common to both sets of interests, as I have explored elsewhere (Buller, 2004), is that the wolf remains constructed through the politics of both conservation and invasion as a purified 'outsider': entirely emblematic of an externalised, and thus essentially dualistic, conception of nature and its relationship to human society

1592

> The relationship of biosecurity to biodiversity is increasingly the relationship between the tame or tamed (essential, controlled, fixed, known, and secure) and the wild (diverse, shifting, unknown, and therefore an element of risk). At one level, 'diversity' and 'security' seem almost intrinsically antagonistic.  Forms of control and governance are most effectively exercised through processes of standardisation and organisation. Foucault offers the widely discussed process of 'normalisation', under which traditional forms of sovereign power are replaced by a normative rationality that orders, classifies, measures, regulates, and corrects individual subjects into a 'civic' and thereby self-defining and self-regulating whole. Diversity, where it exists, becomes subjugated, in some cases through division and isolation, into the norm. 

> Foucault (2004), in one of his lectures to the College de France in 1975, identifies state intervention and control of the natural milieu to reduce the insecurity of `naturality' as one of the key functions of government. In this manner, natural diversity becomes subjected to normalisation, to governmentality

> Was their presence, as the ecologists maintained, the result of natural migration from Italy, where wolves have existed for centuries, or was it, as the hunters and the farmers claim, the result of a deliberate and clandestine reintroduction by militant ecologists, naturalist groups, and, behind them, the French Ministry of the Environment, which was strongly criticised by the Parliamentary Commission set up in response to the wolf crisis (Spagnou, 2003a) for its role in anticipating and concealing the initial colonisation

This reminds of the claims made in the 1930s that conservationists were introducing bear in the Alps

1593

> The significance of the wolves in the French Alps thus lies in the tension they reveal not only between the stasis of conservation and the mobility of threat but also between what are, ultimately, different ontologies of nature: the one grounded in a dualism that sees the nonhuman wolves, the nature they represent, and the spaces they

> occupy as an eternal and fixed reality, empirically distinct from the human; the other a more fluid conception of the world as a complexity of socionatural webs, engaging humans and nonhumans in a process of "still to be formed" (Mol, 1999, page 75)
