> Food habits are pivotal in brown bear ecology and behaviour (Welch et al. 1997, Swenson et al. 1999, Gende & Quinn 2004). The availability and quality of food have strong influences on brown bears’ population dynamics: they affect the age at first reproduction, litter size, breeding interval, body size, population density, home range and habitat selection (Stringham 1986, Blanchard 1987, Stringham 1990, Palomero et al. 1997, Welch et al. 1997, Hilderbrand et al. 1999a, Ferguson & McLoughlin 2000, McLoughin 2000, Nomura & Higashi 2000). Brown bears’ diet has to meet the demands of maintenance, growth, cub rearing, and the accumulation of lipid stores required for winter dormancy, gestation and lactation (Hilderbrand et al. 1999b, Robbins et al. 2007). In order to maximize their growth and fat accumulation, brown bears must balance their energy and nutrient intake according to the most efficient foraging strategy for their body size, thus choosing between a completely frugivorous or a mixed diet (Welch et al. 1997, Rode & Robbins 2000, Rode et al. 2001, Felicetti et al. 2003, Robbins et al. 2007).

According to this paper (fig. 3 on p. 129) brown bears in temperate forests are those who eat the least vertebrates in respect to bears in boreal forests and tundra. Less than 20% of their diet is made up by vertebrates.
