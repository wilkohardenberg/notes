  - old story about the journal: "appeared fully formed around about 350 years ago"
  - institutionalization of journals as institutionalization of new scientific norms

- What is relevant public for scientific claims?
- What forms of judgements are considered legitimate?

1830s marked the birth of proceedings journals [--> is there a connection with conference proceeding series? were they perceived and seen as the same or similar thing???]. According to A. this marks start of actual scientific journals as we understand them today.
_Proceedings_ (bulletins/compte rendus/Berichte) have a different epistemological foundation in respect to _Transactions_ (memoirs)

Historical backdrop: French Revolution meant more periodicals were published. To be considered legitimate a body (parliament/academy/society) needed now to be accessible and accountable!
Reporting on the Academie des Sciences, seen as a means to do politics by other means by radicals that would not have been allowed to run a political journal, led in the 1820s to a broadening and opening to the public of its debates (against Cuvier's opposition, among others). Main actor in this was at first Le Globe, since 1824.
With July Monarchy after 1830 FraÃ§ois Arago became the public face of a more open Academy.

Since summer 1835 Academie published its own proceedings journal as Comptes Rendus des Seances de l'Academie des Sciences.
Proceedings would have changed completely the landscape of scientific literature in the 2nd half of the 19th C.

In UK _Proceedings_ evolved from repositories of abstracts and reports to journals that took over the place that had been of the _Transactions_ (even literally with the discontinuation of the publication of the latter).
19th C. issue of public is central  --> possible readership is seen as potentially much larger than just other experts

See Osiris volume on "Science and Civil Society", Volume 17: http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/distributed/O/bo3626428.html

In 1920s libraries from Anglo-French world attacked German publishers because of diverging standards of publication: "they weren't making scientific literature right" (varying page numbers, unknown subscription costs, inclusion of dissertations in periodicals).

"The perception of a problem is not enough of an explanation for historical causation --> you need different levels of explanation; why was a specific solution chosen for a certain perceived problem"

Amateurship vs professionalization?

A. is interested in studying how people imagine how a more formal system of judgment should be structured, rather than determining what historical system was more rational.
