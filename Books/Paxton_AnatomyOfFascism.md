p. 60: "Above all Mussolini bested D'Annunzio by serving economic and social interests as well as nationalist sentiment. He made his Blackshirts available for action against socialists as well as against the South Slavs of Fiume and Trieste. War veterans had hated the socialists since 1915 for their "antinational" stance during the war. Big planters in the Po Valley, Tuscany, Apulia and other regions of large estates hated and feared the socialists for their success at the end of the war in organizing the _braccianti_, or landless laborers, to press for higher wages and better working conditions"

p. 62: d'Annunzio --> Fascism as "agrarian slavery", in Seton-Watson "Italy from Liberalism to Fascism", p. 616
