**Kupper, Patrick. Creating Wilderness: A Transnational History of the Swiss National Park. New York: Berghahn Books, 2014.**

p. 1 The national park is problematic: the term covers a variety of concepts and entities. " Individual parks differ vastly, not only in appearance but also in purpose: biodiversity, landscape conservation, or wilderness; tourism, education, or research. The term 'national park' provides a common denominator for all this global diversity, yet the denominator itself is indistinct. One might aptly summarize the paradox by saying that all national parks are not equal, yet they are still national parks, which however, does not illuminate the phenomenon much further."

p. 1-2 The significance of the SNP is not due in the first place to its extension or its early emergence but rather to the founders' core idea that total protection was no aimed at 'nature preservation' as such, thus "to preserve nature in its 'original' form as it was to return such nature to modern civilization and to scientifically support and validate the process required to achieve this goal. This experimental component made the SNP into the global prototype of a science-oriented national park".

p. 3 discussion of American vs Swiss model in global debate about NPs around 1900. "The SNP particiapted in this process by introducing a distinct, scientifically oriented variant of the national park that became an internationally recognized point of reference around the world."

p. 4 referring to Nash "Wilderness is not an objective category but a state of mind; it os a by product of the process of individual and social appropriation of nature. Accordingly it is important to perennially historicize wilderness, and to situate  it both in time and in space. What wilderness means--whether something to fear or to desire, to beat back or to protect--has always been the result of social communication."

The Swiss were aware that wilderness disappeared a long time ago and needed to be (re)produced [can I make a reference to reclamation as conservation?]

"The alpine primeval nature to be restored to the SNP was a wilderness 'such as had adorned the Alps as a pure creation of nature before the intrusion of humans' [cites the Reservationenkommittee SNK in a letter of 15 Dec 1908]" Swiss and American idea were actually close, difference was essentially that Americans believed that prehistorical nature was still there in the Far West! It coalesces in the idea that wilderness has no humans in it [difference to the practice of Italian national parks and their acceptance of the fact that humans were unavoidable]

p. 5 Preservation is a consequence of Western modernity, independently from the nuances of local and national interpretations. "Without these inisghts in the historical mutability of nature, [produced by the theory of evolution] the national park idea and especially the Swiss interpretation of it would have been unthinkable".

What Charles Maier (2000) calls _territorialization_ also affected the rise of preservationism: the increasing occupation of land spurred desire to carve out nature preserves [and here I wonder if, instead, in parallel, one could make a point on previous forms of territorialization and needs of protection as those produced by royal hunting reserves]

p. 5-6 "The national park was conceived as a natural space or wilderness separate from social space, that is, the space of culture or civilization."

Carl Schröter, botanist and chair of the SNP commission, (1918) stated "[The national park] is primarily a place where any human interference is prohibited for all time, and where alpine ur-nature can and will recover undisturbed and continue to evolve. It offers a refuge for plants and animals, a sanctuary, a sacred place for nature. Its borders serve as a breakfront for the waves of human culture flowing from every nation, whihc have destroyed the youthful countenance of Mather Earth: the park is a place apart from 'ecumenism,' from the sphere of colonization." He also stressed the ethical value of a park because it preserved everything for all the people...

The park as Foucauldian heterotopia and a concept imbued of modernity! Example of how boundaries between nature and culture are socially construed.

p. 7 [if Kupper aims at "reconstructing the historical processes in which the park was made into a place of alpine wilderness, and illuminate the consequences", my book aims at going beyond this as to analyse the role of conflicts in constantly mediating the role and ability to act of state agencies charged with nature preservation. But then it seems he does this as well]

p. 13-37 Chapter on the globalization of the idea of NP

p. 16-7 "Consequently, the history of social and technological innovation now focuses not on inventors  and their inventions but rather on the communicative processes of negotiation that both support and, even more important, literally shape these developments. Thus, media and forums of social negotiation move to the center of attention."

p. 17 thus, construed nature of the myth of yellowstone as starting step of the global development of the idea of NPs. "internationally conservationists made Yellowstone into their own founding myth" (Brockington 2008).

p. 18 Nash 1980 apparently gives account of the story of how even if Yellowstone was not defined officially as a NP from the beginning, it was so informally from the beginning. Also see Alfred Runte
Later ideological structures of what a NP ought to be were absent at its founding.

p. 19 the American park concept (e.g. Yosemite or public urban parks), stressing its public nature, distanced itself from the European aristocratic tradition. YEllowstone is linked to the first of these traditions.
Moreover american tradition aimed at protecting natural wonders, mainly as individual features, as a parallel to European historical monuments.
In 1873 The Times reported about Yellowstone under the heading "A Very National Park"

p. 20
"In the 1870s and 1880s, national parks were founded in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia. Each of these British settler societies interpreted the American model in their own way, with the first Autralian national park in Sidney more strongly oriented to the periurban parks of London's imperial metropolis than to the park far from the city in the American West. Together these developments represent initiatives that placed the exploitation of tracts of land under state control. Whether in those years similar efforts were being made somewhere in Europe is not known"

p. 21
prolly not: "The possession of land in Europe was usually clearly defined and was mainly in private or communal hands and, apart from state forests in certain countries, was rarely under the control of central government. The potential for a nation-state to demonstrate ownership of disputed land by designating it a national park was exploited by Europe only in the twentieth century. Early examples include the establishment of NPs in areas of Sweden inhabited by Sami (Lapp) people since 1909, and Stelvio NP, created in 1935 by fascist Italy in formerly Austrian territory." Stress how Europe paid more attention to cultural than natural heritage as a means to symbolise the nation.

from p. 24 section on "The Value of Unspoiled Nature"

p. 30 at the turn of the century rapid depletion of African megafauna had startled scientists, hunters, and colonial officers

p. 31 following Conwentz's heed the "natural monument" became in the early 20th c. "the key concept of an early European discourse on nature conservation."

"The European natural monument represented a protective strategy comprising many small areas, in contrast to the American national park, which epitomized an approach oriented to protecting large areas." Sweden showed early that the two strategies could be pursued in combination.

p. 41 the idea of repatriating the ibex was part of the SNP plans since the very beginning, in Schröter's proposal of the Val S-charl of 1906.

Chapter 2 beautiful account of how the park came into place where it came into place

p. 46 also SNP was leased. Acquisition was deemed uneconomical. costs estimated at 10.000 franc a year. Attempt at financing via public subscription in addition to state funds.

p. 48 primary role of Chief Forestry Inspector

p. 48-49 yearly 30,000 francs in rent. 99 year lease. The one with Zernez could be quit unilaterally by the government after 25. S-chanf, Scuol and the alpine cooperative Tavrü rejected the latter rule. [this rent was equivalent approximately to the whole budget assigned to the PNGP 12 years later: http://www.historicalstatistics.org/Currencyconverter.html. If the comparison is made between the value in the same year (1922) it is about 120,000 lira]

P. 49 "[Glarner democrat David] Legler considered the information on the extinction of animal and plant species to be highly exaggerated and for that reason denied the need for a large reserve. The biggest beneficiaries of the national park would be predators, whose protection Legler described not only as an 'absurdity' but also a threat to visitors to the park and the surrounding areas. In any event, the possibility of intervention was includedin case bears did return—which proponents hoped would happen—or some other undesirable development came to pass. Article 1 of the resolution was amended to state that 'All flora and fauna is allowed to develop naturally and protected from human influence _that is not consistent with the goals of the national park.' In this way, the concerns of some of the parliamentarians were addressed."

Legler also claimed the park, decentered as it was, would be a poaching ground for Italian hunters. Also worrisome was the issue how a decentered park could be representative of the nation.

Later proposals (interwar period) for further parks stressed political and national representation over scientific and environmental grounds, even among the natural scientists.  

p. 52 success of 'national park' due to its easy translatability? new combination, not burdened by a history of diverging meanings (like the term _reserve_ wa e.g. in French/German comparison) stressing a national dimension that lay at core of public debates of the time [and a leisure dimension that brought forward the institution's romantic qualities.] The latter however often gained of importance in respect to the scientific qualities a _reserve_ ought have had to have. [A park has to be beautiful, a reserve not necessarily. The Am interpretation strongly supported the first of these approaches.] Already in 1909 in Switzerland some (Peider Lansel) supported the idea of an alpine garden, like the one suggested for the Gran Paradiso in the 1930s, more similar to a zoo or botanical garden than a park as we understand it now. Is this due to a misinterpretation of the terminology?

p. 53 Yellowstone had a bison enclosure. To react to these proposals the SNk built a correlation between NP and wilderness that was still uncommon. Further reference to beginning of Schröter (1918) on the need to distance themselves from the idea that a park was a cultivated grade.

"the worldwide use of this brand made it possible to relate, through a common terminology, different ideas and concepts that spanned great distances and boundaries of all sorts. In the 1920s, Schröter suspected that national park idea, would find widespread use 'precisely because of its suggestive effect' (1924, 387)"

p. 54 appeal of the national park nomiker to governments with a nationalist agenda. [the garden feature of the park also appealed to fascist ears, possibly]

"It is certainly not the case that the idea of the national park spread easily from one country to another around the world. Rather, complex translations of the term arose that had a retroactive effect on countries that adopted the term early, and later served as models for imitators. Those with a growing interest in national parks selected from the available offerings, let their creativity run riot, combined and modified what was handed down, and enriched it with their own ideas. In turn, the designation 'national park' ensured for each individual creation international connectivity and visibility, though not all the 'parks' in the conservation  market attracted th same attention and appreciation."

p. 58-9 Italy was among the powers tha agrred to particpate in Paul Sarasin's proposal for an International Nature Protection Commission in 1913. The commission in the end however was only consultative and had limited powers in respect to Sarasin's hopes

p. 59-60 WWI acted as a damper on most parks planned in the alpine area: no park in Livigno, no German alpine park, and la Berarde, best. 1913, disappeared in oblivion. And attempts at restarting post war fell because conservation lost of appeal and many conservationists died in the conflict.

[all over the place] contract with Zernez signed in 1910, state recognition granted in 1914 (August 1). In Sweden instead all parks were created at once by the state.

p. 71 even after decades of co-habitation relationship between communes and park tenuous. Issue of lack of connection [shall I do the same and relate a much later story to contextualize the previous story?]

"The problem of how to establish a national park in a specific, local environment comes up again and again, all over the world, and must always be dealt with anew." Central issue here is environmentality "'the knowledges, politics, institutions, and subjectivities that come to be linked together with the emergence of the environment as a domain that requires regulation and protection' (Agrawal 2005, 226). In particular, for Agrawal it is about understanding how state-controlled environmental regulations and subjective attitudes toward the environment affect each other and are thereby changed."

p. 72 "around the world, precarious relations with the local population are a defining characteristic of the national park as an institution"

p. 73 possibiltiyt of integration in NPs of local population: in Europen and LatAm this meant preservation of cultural landscapes rather than wilderness (Mexico, Holland (see Civilizing Nature), England); in Africa and Asia it meant integration of indigineous pop in preservation plans (Sweden, Congo, Malaysia). Latte approach limited what pops could do in park to what was consistent with preservation: "'forced primitivism'"

p. 75 "In Switzerland, there was no question of having living humans as objects of a national nature protection program. To the contrary, the search for large conservation areas focused on spaces devoid of human settlement. None of the areas included in the SNP contained permanently inhabited dwellings, thereby avoiding the need for relocations. […] while no settlements were abandoned in creating teh national park, use of the land for agriculture and forestry was no longer permitted, a turn of events that met with some disapproval among the local population"

p. 76-77 Lower Engine poor, subsistenxe, depopulating

p. 82 gives prosopography of local elites. [raises question: who are my actors? are they just farmers in an underdeveloped area, or rather businesspeople with links to broader networks]

p. 83 "The context of communal ownership in CH was completely different from other countries and regions of the world" US, Sweden, Africa all allowed for state property

p. 85 "For the eventuality that area-based hunting was to succeed licensed hunding in the canton of Grisons, which was discussed time and again but never happened, additional compensation for hunting rights would be pait to the commune" special regulations for bear and ibex: for the second indemnification and possible shooting of the animal was foreseen (agreement of 1910 btw zernez and SNK).

Clear timeline, and expansion to 99 years (from 25) once control was taken by the state.

p. 90 the comune of Tarasp refused the park idea, because the area eyed for conservation contained its only alpine pasture.

p. 91 long term allowed to avoid constant rediscussion of terms of lease. Everything seems to be built in a system of reference. Nothing similar was achieved in GP

p, 92 30,000 is a ceiling stipulated by law, rather than an actual expense (?). 11.800 franc was what remained available to pay for all other leases, fi the 18.200 set apart for Zernez is considered. [what is difference between lease and easement?]

p. 94 1929 ENPK nasb skiing in the park

p. 95 Alp Tavrü only treated as partially protected and leased back to community for grazing. Declared by govt no hunting zone: portection ensured even without lease. In  Scuol upon exit from the park all park payments were withdrawn: lack of ways to exploit the areas soon sent the commune back into the park.

p. 96 economic crisis, like 1910s ban on cross border transhumance, increased the local communities' need for the park to cover for costs. They became economic incentives for the park./=

No tool existed at institutional level to resolve conflicts

Representative from Grisons in ENPK, introduced in 1918, expected to "exert a positive influence of the communities". 1920 also added French speaking rep from Naturforschend Gesellschaft, to cover national representation. There was however no community representative on the board. Their active participation in governing the park was not part of the lease deal. Repeated, unsuccesful attempts to get a Zernez representative in the 1920s and 1960s. Communes as counterparties.. Relationship of antagonism. for the communes the park had been sold off to Bern.

in 1930s attempt to link national park to Romansh culture.

p. 98 locally park was seen as imposition of a foreign atjority, just like in  Africa and Asia. But in Switzerland all decisions were taken following democratic processes, could not be more different than in colonial and post-colonial context.

p. 99 rangers came increaisngly from the region, but locals wer excluded from admin

p. 107 Frnch *Societe nationale d'acclimatation de France* organized a tour of Central European parks in summer 1935: PNS. Karwendel, GrossGlockner, Triglav, Tatra, Pieniny (no GP). Detailed report published in _Des Eaux et Forets_ and _La terre et la vie_, divided parks in two cat: total protection vs partial. Only SNP was in the first one. Separation of reserves btw partial and total protection derived from the existence of the SNP and was part of its model. the coexistence of total and partial reserves was embedded in the original palns of 1908 for the park: three categories were proposed, total reserves, game reserves, flora reserves above treeline. 

"The committee members anticipated that it would not be possible to leave vast areas completely to nature."

So the park always included also only partially protected areas, such as Alp Tavrü, stocked with cattle from 1911 til 1936, or the no-hunting area in lower Engadine (ca. 1930-1962). 

Pardè, L., 1935 "Visite de quelques parcs national de l'Europe centrale" Revue des eaux et des forets (June/July) 485-97, 585-93

p. 108 But most of the aprk ensured the principle of "freely developing nature"

not the first national park, but the "first total, fully portected large reserve on Earth" (quoted from Sarasin 1914 _Über die Aufgaben des Weltnaturschutzes_, Basel)

1928 League of Nations produced a list of national parks, identified by concept and ranked: top spots given to SNP and Spanish parks, "which served as a model for developing nature through tourism" (list quoted in Wöbse's pice in _Civilizing Nature_)

See Smith 1947 Nature Protection in Great Britain , _Nature_ (4066, 4 October), 457-9

p. 109 IUCN categories: national park was attributed the American meaning (cat. 2) need to introduce cat Ia: Strict Nat Res to cover neatly SNP. How does intro of ibex cope with total protection? Is it not an unduly interference?

p. 111 largest and fastest growing ibex colony in Switzerland actually outside of park, got out attarcted by salt licks. All animals paoched from GP.

"Years later, Emil Bächler, the Peter and Paul Wildlife Park's ibex expert, accused two Italian poachers from the neighboring Livigno Valley of having chased the two ibex from the park and also having shottwo bucks on the same occasion" (possibly untrustwoirthy because of time lapsed since event, but believable) "Not only were worries about cross-border poaching in the national park widespread in those years, but park and border authorities routinley skrimished with poachers who crossed into the park through the borders it shared with Italy. In 1923, one such case ended fatally for a man from Livigno." (ENPK annual report 1923, 5f.)

Salt licks introduced in 1921 to keep ibex within the park: against original park policy??? How do reintro and lick reconcile with 'total protection'

p. 112 original statute left rome for intervention! The original "protected from any human influence", disliked by parliament, was amended to read "from any influence not in the interest of the national park". Devised as a mean to be able to counteract spread of predators and epidemics.

But reintroduction not defensive: conservationists needed to explain! blatant violation of mantra "freely developing nature". But reintroudcing the ibex in the area had been a dream of conservationists since before the park was set up (Schroeter said it in 1906 and the possibility was retained in the first leases)

Interest in alpine fauna swelled in parallel to Romantic enthusiasm: Niklaus Friedrich von Tschudi _Das Thierleben der Alpen_ (1853) is proof. Re-establishment of ibex was campaigned for by charitable organisations and scientific societies alike.

Since the 1876 reform of game law the Swiss confederation had committed itself to colonise the no-hunting areas with ibex. On this basis the confederation later funded the questionable import of poached fawns from the GP area.

p. 113 "In their 1920 report to the ENPK, the experts [about ibex from the wild parks] explained that it was 'an old, fundamentally distorted view that ibex preferredto live around glaciers, snow, and rocky deserts. No! It was humans, with their culture (alpine commerce and hunting), who dorve the ibex higher and brought about their extinction due to more precarious living conditions. Ibex need food to live, not snow and ice,'"

Ibex however left the theoretically more propitiois area chosen, with much conflict, for Val Cluozza, which was more barren.

p. 115 Salt licks were introduced to counteract the salt licks set up by hunters to lure the ibex out of the park. Feeding stations were banned, to much chagrin of the hunting associations that believed the animals would have starved without. Both went against 'total protection', but salt licks appeared as essential to keep the animals within the park.

'Total protection' or not human interventions continued to be common within the park. Artificial salt licks used to lure animals to livea natural life in the park (oh, the irony).

p. 116 The history of animals only writable through human descriptions: nonetheless animals are notsimply dominated objects, but can be actors with their autonomy. 

"Interpretations of theirpast behavior is thus necessarily based on human descriptions, whether contemporary accounts or subsequent analyses based on material remains, genetic investigations, and biological models." (see Marvin 2009, in Brants & Mauch _Tierische Geschichten_)

Compare Andrew Isenberg (2002, in Rothfels, _Representing Animals_) on the moral ecologgy of wildlife: "that sees the natural order as a higher, morally and scientifically incorruptible order and humans as a disruptive influence." This thought light at the root of the ideas that nature would work towards equilibrium if left alone form human influences.

p. 117 PArk boundaries are at the same time distinction between in and out and interface between the two.

Parks are inherently modern institutions: heterotopies, in which natural history ought to evolve free from the constraints of cultural history. This is a fully modern paradigm.

p. 118 discusses idea of setting up a park in the Livigno area to protect the international border of the park from poacher infiltrations. Switzerland contacted teh Italian government about it, but the plan did not make much headway.

Hige differences between reality and practice of the job of a park warden. Swiss park wardens had to keep diary of daily activities, with observations of plants and animals.

 p. 119 often only short tenures for park wardens. "The remoteness of the position—the supervisor and the members of the park commission lived far away, in the midlands, and were only rarely seen—apparently led wardensto take their duties less than seriosly or to interpret them willy-nilly."

local resentment and envy towars wardens as the only ones allowed to leave the marked tracks.

p. 120 increasing preference to locals in selection process.conflicts between wardens and supervisor. Salary 1800 francs a year. Later increased

p. 121 early 20s 4 wardens got > 15,000 francs altogether, including expenses and other costs. "The SBN was responsible for these posts, which threatened to throw its budget and, consequently, the national park out of balance."

"Relief came directly from the federal government when it agreed to delegate the task of monitoring the park to its national border patrol. In 1923 the park warden for S-charl sectoer was relieved, and in the following year the park commission also said farewell to the warden in Buffalora. Their duties were taken over byt the border patrols at S-charl and La Drossa, joined by S-chanf in 1933. Consequently following Hermann Langen's resignation in 1936, for several years, Romedi Reinalter served as sole park warden."

Only in the 1960s park wardens became federal officers on the same footing as the border patrol. And number increased first to 6 and then to 10. Using current sizes and maximum number of PNGP wardens of 40 the latter had to cover an area thsat was a third of thos in PNS.

p. 122 "Strict separation of the aprk and surrounding areas, of wilderness and civilisation, was a high priority. However, because this separation was not phisically possible —a permanent fence around the area was discussed but quicly dropped for reasons of feasibility—it was always precarious. fears that the separation would be breached and the wildernessand civilization would mix preoccupied park affairs over the years. the concern was not only the intrusion of civilization into the park, as described above, but also the emergence of uncontrolled park wildernessand its incursion into the civilized surroundings … Effectively containing such fears was critical to the legitimacy of the park and the concept of total protection."

The fact that free-ranging wildlife could not spread hoof-and-mouth had been proven by the experiment by the British (according to ENPK reports)

p. 125 in SNP original presence of a species was main criteria to allow its reintroduceability. Binary distinction beteen native and alien is arbitrary, as species composition is geo-historically variable. (Coates 2006 _American Perceptions of Immigrant and Invasive Species: Strangers on the Land_)

common practice in American parks of early 20th century to imbed plants, including alien species to make landscape more appealing

as for ibex: "after the initial stock in Val Cluozza stabilized, a second colony was established in Val Tantermozza in the 1930s" see Nievergelt 1966 _Der Alpensteinbock (Capra Ibex L.) in seinem Lebensraum: Ein oekologischer Vergleich verschiedener Kolonien_, Hamburg 

p. 126 PNS officials sttod explicitly against prevailing division between useful and harmful animals.

p. 139 "For the members of the _Schewizerische Naturschutzkommission_ (SNK), themselves all scientists, that the national park should serve scientific research was a foregone conclusiuon requiring no explanation. A firm grounding in the natural sciences was instrumental in shaping the park."

In Italy early park were set up mainly for reasons of opportunity, rather than strictly on the basis of an analysis of ecological criteria (as in CH)

p. 141 Schröter looked fore retrograde succession: barring humans from an area would have allowed plans to reevolve towards a status in which they were before human interference. Restoration of a primeval biocenosis, as a he wrote in one of the park's early research repors in 1919. He even calls it a reqlding experiment.

[not rewilding but preservation was the aim in GP]

"The new field site should enable biologists non less than new epistemic access to their object of study. "Herbaria, gardens, and laboratories must be joined with the protected area," wrote Schröter, citing his Berlin colleague Diels." (1924)

p. 149 thre taditiopnal locus of biologica research, the field, lost academic prestige. See Kohler _Landscapes and Labscapes_. Gathering and classifying were pushed to the background, in favour of the lab

p. 150 Schröter presented the park as an openair or outdoor lab. But it lacked possibility to experiment: nature was the only allowed experimenter. Science remained observational

p. 152 already in 1918 the presence of too many researchers was seen by th eWNPK as a threat to total protection

p. 154-5 Soviet _Zapovednik_ only other form of nature conservation institution that gave the same pre-eminence to research as SNP
