Norton wise the rhetoric of precision of the late 18th century. basis of organization and control in all bureaucratic states leading to need for uniform measurements. Feedback between needs of central states and technical advancements of measuring instruments. 

Lavoisier attempted to construct a thermometer to register the health and wealth of the entire economy. Lagrange and nutrition, Adam Smith and the wealth of the nation

Movement of the metric system from its broader scope of standardizing commerce, taxation and monetary system to current interpretation as rationalized system of measurment for the sciences derived from universal phenomena of nature. Primary value was uniformity.

"Mary Douglas has argued that indeed every society, whether "primitive" or "modern," attempts to project its most cherished beliefs into nature, that this externalization is one of the primary means by which sameness is constructed and common institutions established"

"The constituted a network of interrelated but diverse technologies which gave susbtance to the belief that the laws of nature, left ot themselves, acted to produce equilibrium  between opposing tendencies and to average out irregularity" need for an instrument which would reveal the equilibrium conditions: a balance.

"The dream had limitations, then and now. It assumes an ease about numerical facts, about their relation to laws, andabout who is qualified to judge. Such ease is rare in the history of measurement, not to speak government policy. 

"A uniform system of measurement to be accepted must express the values of the different constitutencies that it affects."

p. 103 "German military needs especially had furthered precision technology in geodesy, optics and electrical communication"

"The product of meticolous experimental protocols and later of more delicate and accurate apparatus, refined measurements joined the plethora of the several novel forms of quantification that permeated the sciences, daily life, and especially the state's bureaucracies across the nineteenth century."

"The techniques and instruments that produced more accurate weights and measures ... migrated early in the century to the sciences where they formed the nucleus of exact experimental practice."

"By the end of the century the physicist Emil Warburg noted that because of the time, effort and expenditure involved, precision measurements were value-laden choices and therefore it was "a task of great importance to find the right choice".

"'Exact' refers to the perceptions of nature's image and ecperiment's character, especially in physics, that accompanied refined masurements." Nature increasingly viewed in fine-grained quantitative terms (whose choice was itself a value judgment predicated on this emerging sensibility.
