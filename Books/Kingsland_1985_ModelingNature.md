1 population ecology is the study of how organisms interact in an environment (more than sun, air, earth, and water)
  "Population ecology grew up alongside population genetics and confronted many of the same problems as its companion, problems involving the use of mathematics and the difficulties of integrating theoretical, experimental, and field approaches."
2 "But it was a separate area of study, the other side of the coin, the analysis of the day-to-day interactions that make up the struggle for     existence."
  1920s people recognized limitations of attention to the individual and its interaction with environment was restrictive: too many interaction were omitted. Attempts to understand structure of communities were leading to too great masses of observations, and lack of guiding principles. Attractiveness of middle level, population.
  First to "explore the possibilities of a mathematical representation of population growth, predation, and competition" were not ecologists: ideas and methods came from physical and human science. "Mathematical models were drastically oversimplified: what did a set of equations have to do with the moiling crowd of the real world." The produced however new ideas, and by the 1940s modeling had a small, but firm foothold in the ecological literature.
  By mid-forties while pop eco establishment was made up by practitioners of field and lab ecology, the discipline's theoretical content came from the outside
3 where mathematicians were construing it without much sense of the biological.
  "The search for simple 'laws,' always a tempting exercise for ecologists in envy of the physical sciences, would have to give way to the development of more sophisticated techniques of analysis. These would require not only more biological information, but more mathematics and eventually the aid of computers."
  "Ecology, always a fragmented discipline, was by now entering an expansive phase which would produce by the late 1960s a science largely reconstituted as ecological engineering."
  "The use of new instruments and techniques was accompanied by new rigor in the use of mathematics. Not only were ecologists becoming versed in"
4 "quantitative and statistical biology, but in collaboration with mathematicians they were turning also to more esoteric branches of mathematics which were growing quickly during and after the war years. These included systems theory, information theory, mathematical programming, and game theory."
  Computer simulations became interesting by the mid-1960s. they would become essential in population dynamics within a few years.
5 ""But there is no final end toward which all tends, no fixed answer that serves as a marker of progress: what is sought is a better understanding of the connectedness of nature's parts. The history of ecology is a history of changing criteria for imposing order on nature and resisting the alternative that all is really chaotic and contingent. Ecology is interesting not just for the answers it comes up with , for these are often temporary , but for the way the methods of imposing upon nature reflect changing times, changing moods."
  "In ecology as distinct from most other areas of the biological and physical sciences, many of the questions asked have traditionally been viewed historically. What we observe is the culmination of a unique series of events which can be pieced together only to the extent that there remain traces in the historical record, or to the extent that past processes can be inferred from presently acting ones."
  "The general goal of the mathematical method is not at odds with the investigative historical method. Both are intended to uncover more information about the world. But the mathematical way of thinking, that is, the use of models to construct plausible scenarios, while commonplace in the physical sciences, is in its ahistorical character opposed to the way of thinking familiar to most ecologists. The difficulty of trying to reconcile these two ways of thinking has been the source of much controversy."
206 "From 1920 to 1970 theoretical ecology moved from the margin to a permanent and more central place in ecology. [...] Problems in resource management continue to rely mathematical modeling techniques."
209 the success of mathematical ecologyin generating hyotheses and in raising the field's status is undeniable
