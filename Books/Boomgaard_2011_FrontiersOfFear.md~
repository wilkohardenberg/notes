History of the invisible: rarity and lack of encounters

> The American anthropologist Clifford Geertz introduced the term "theatre state" for Bali in the nineteenth century (Geertz 1980). Some scholars have criticized this notion, but we can borrow the image without accepting all the implications. If we visualize the states of the Malay world, the colonial state included, as stages upon which the normal human drama is acted upon, this book takes the reader backstage. Yet the tiger is not only the guardian of the area backstage, the forest; he is also to be found on the _kayon_, the marker used by the puppeteer to demarcate the stage of the Javanese shadow play.

The landscape we are looking at is an agrarian one, characterized by transhumant and resident livestock economy, more than by a wilderness where "time had stood still". 

> The reader will see how environmental change, often but not always man-made, influences the tiger's habitat directly and indirectly. It is also shown how the tiger's reaction to such distrubances has influenced human behaviour in turn.

> The tiger, is like all big cats, a carnivore and a predator. Tigers kill game and domesticated animals, including pets, a feature that did not endear them to humans. More importantly tigers were also reputed to kill humans. It was the so-called man-eater who was resposnible for such atrocities. Nowadays, man-eating is very rare, and various tiger specialists have recently argued that it was never important, more an "orientalist" myth than anything else. This book sets the record straight about man-eating.

"Beasts of prey have no history. A panther can indeed have a biography and a colony of termites even state annals, but they do not have history in the great distinguishing sense of human history as 'world history'. A life of prey yields no history" (Buber 1965, 108-09) _Between Man and Man_, NY, Macmillan

> However, it will be shown that such a clear-cut distinction is problematic. I discuss the question as to whether tigers are influenced in their behavior by the proximity of humans and by changes in human behavior. It will also be discussed whether humans adapt (sufficiently) to tigers, whether such adaptations vary between places and periods, and how these mutual adaptations seem to imply learning processes at both sides of the frontier between humans and tigers.
