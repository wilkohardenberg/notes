Nancy Jacobs _Birders of Africa_

6-7 "**Why birds?**"
"Birds constitute less than 1 percent of known species yet are good to think of historically bcause of what they are: 'large, sexually  reproducing, diploid, warm-blooded vertebrate animals, with separate sexes, color vision, internal fertilization, and relatively large brains. these traits make them more like us than the majority of other living thing.' Their sociability, especially, attracts human attention. Their courtship seems ritualized and suggest companionship. They care for their young with dedication and enough variety to make it interesting."

7 "The social lives of birds inspired the anthropologist Claude Lévis-Strauss to note their unique pull on people" birds 'form a community which is independent of our own but, precisely because of this independence, appears to us like another society, homologous to that in which we live.'"

14 Various forms of knowledge and interaction, the oldest being the vernacular: all over the world birds have been hunted, chased, observed, used for decoration etc.
"I prefer 'vernacular' to 'local'–––science is also specific to its context, not universal–––and to 'indigenous'–––Europeans also have vernacular knowledge, and whether a society experienced settler colonialism is not the most important factor characterizing environmental knowledge."
"A lot of vernacular knowledge would qualify as _mētis_, the skill- and experience-based knowledge described by political scientist James Scott, but not everything known about birds need to be practical."
