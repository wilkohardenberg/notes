How do phenomena come into being and pass away as objects of scientific inquiry

In much of the debate, the opposition between nature and culture shadows that between the real and the construed: nature stands for the eternal, the inexorable, the universal; culture for the variable, the malleable, the particular. Scientific objects can be at the same time real and historical.

Each of the eleven essays documents in detail how a heretofore unknown, ignored, or dispersed set of phenomena is transformed into a scientifi object that can be observed and manipulated, that is capable of theoretical ramifications and empirical surprises, and that coheres, at least for a time, as an ontological entity. Scientific objects flout the boundaries between scientific disciplines.

Rheinberger"experimental systems embed scientific objects into a borader field of material scientific culture and practice, including the realm of instrumentation and inscription devices as well as the model organisms to which these objects are generally connected, and the fluctuating concepts to which they are bound."

"scientific objects may not be invented, but they grow more richly real as they become entangled in webs of cultural significance, material practices, and theoretical derivations." Ever more connected to other phenomena, and at the same time yield ever more layers of hidden structure.
