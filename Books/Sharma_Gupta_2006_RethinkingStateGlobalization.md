**Introduction: rethinking theories of the stare in an age of globalization**

7 "concept of nation state has so thoroughly conjoined the state with the nation that it is almost impossible to think of one without the other (aretxaga 2003; trouillot 2003)"
Theories of the state always have implicit in them theories of nationalism. State, nation, nation-state are used interchangeably. Anderson 1983; Steinmetz 1999
Theories of the state however are larfgely silent on Qs of cultural differences. "states are seen as being devoid of culture"

8 systems theorists favoured study of broader political systems in respect to states, whcih appeared as difficult to delineate. (See pdf for refs)

In state-centric theories the state is a clearly bounded, discrete entity, separate from society. 
Mitchell (1991) "has argued that the appearance of the state as a discrete and relatively autonomous social institution is itself a reification that is constituted throug everyday social practices." Drawing the line between society and state is thus an exercise in poer and social control.

9 interest in _how_ the state assumes its role at the apex of the social pyramid. 
Rather than being state dependent rule is "coordinated and consolidated" through dispersed institutional and social networks. what roles do ""non-state" institutions, communities, and individuals play in mundane processes of governance"? Foucault 1991: 103 "_etatisation_ of society"

10 "structural and functional conceptions of the state view it as a set of institutions that performs specific functions related to governance and security" 
" a liberal democratic state and a totalitarian state might actually look alike at the level of everyday practices of state bureaucracies."

11 "an anthropological perspective allows us to pay careful attention to the cultural constitution of the state -- that is, how people perceive tha state, how their understandings are shaped by their particular locations and intimate and embodied encounters with state processes and officials, and how the state manifests itself in their lives" thus, how is the state instantiated and experienced... This "enables us to see thatthe illusion of cohesion and unitariness created by states is always contested and fragile, and is the result of hegemonic processes that should not be taken for granted"

Bureaucratic proceduralism is considered apolitical: "technical work of the state" according to Ferguson (1994). "At another level, however, it is these putatively technical and unremarkable practices that render tenable the political tasks of state formation, governance , and the exertion of power" se Scott

"Mundane bureaucratic procedures thus provide important clues to understanding the micropolitics of state work, how state authority and government operate in ...

12 people's daily lives, and how the state comes to be imagined, encountered, and reimagined by the population."

13 "official procedures are not devised or directed by anyone in particular. They are authorless strategies through which power is exercised and inequalities instituted."

The repetitive enactment of bureaucratic procedures _is_ the core of bureaucratic authority _and_ the state.
"It is _through_ these re-enactments that the coherence and continuity of state institutions is constituted and sometimes destabilized." Performativity?

"Proceduralism, the banal repetition of everyday actions, and the mundane realities of following precedent, reproduce 'the state' as an institution across time and space." These mundane actions also establish the state's supremacy over other social institutions. Proceduralism and precedent setting also produce and maintain social inequalities (class, gender, power).

14 potential for subversion always existent: primacy of written word and strong hierarchilasation can produce conflict and suspicions.

16 "paying attention to everyday bureaucratic practices thus brings to light the sources and nature of interbureaucratic conflicts, which may help explain impediments to the proper implementation of development programs"

"intra-institutional conflict is considered dysfunctional in the ideal-type Weberian bureaucracy -- it poses obstacles to the smooth functioning and reproduction of the institution. Yet we argue that far from being symbols of the improper development of states, these conflicts , 'corruptions,' and inconsistencies are _central_ to institutional organization and the reproduction of states."

Line between state and non state is drawn by the encounters of the bureacrats with others, also through day to day work.

17 "the boundary between state and non-state realms is thus drawn through the contested cultural practices of bureaucracies, and people's encounters with, and ngotiations of, these practices"

Bureaucratic procedures can be used by non-state actors to counteract and sabotage state interventions!!!

Role of a bureaucratic tone of voice and its elemenst of performance (letterhead, seals, and so on). If bureaucracy is a performance, these elementsare central to the deteremination of the powerplay within it.

18 representation is crucial to the transmission of the meaning of the state within and outside the bureaucratic sphere

19 "how people read representations is mediated by their daily encounters with bureaucratic practices"
