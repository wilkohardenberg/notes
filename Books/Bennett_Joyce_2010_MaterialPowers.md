_Material Powers_, Introduction, Patrick Joyce and Tony Bennett, 1-21

1 "A view of power that is at variance with most mainstream accounts. In these power is akin to a quantity, a property essentially to a thing. Some have more, some less, some none at all. And this power originates in particular places, for example in classes, institutions and states."

2 "The view of power adopted here involves conceiving of it as omnipresent, and as constantly ebbing and flowing, collecting and dispersing, in changing combinations and arrangements. Rather than a thing or property, it is more like a condition of action that is made manifest in the practices through which it is performed and exercised." Deep debt to Foucault.
"According to this perspective, if power is dispersed in such a manner it cannot have a single source, or set of sources, from which it springs, as if these sources were the places where power is made. These sources have traditionally numbered classes, institutions, persons, the human subject itself, and especially important in the present regard, the state."
Need to go beyond the state as a reified entity towards its interpretation as a "site of passage of and between different powers."
"The accretion or clustering of these systems of power, or more simply powers, at the level of 'the state' since the sixteenth century forms a process that [...] has come to be called the governmentalisation of the state, something which the state may sometimes drive but of which it is very often neither the author nor the master."
State thought of in terms of relationships, in particular shifting ones between 'state' and 'society'. (Mitchell, 2002)

3 bureaucratic powers cluster in the state, from where they are redeployed "but they may lodge themselves so firmly as to outlive the state, or to function in ways that are parasitic upon it and inimical to it."
bureaucratic power better to say than state power? Sharma, Aradhana, and Akhil Gupta. 2006. The Anthropology of the State: A Reader. Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell Pub.
Governmentality can be definide as "the various rationales and technologies that are involved in the governance of human conduct generally and, especially but not exclusively, those concerned with the governance of the state"

4 how to designate the material as something that _exercises_, but does not _have_ power?
"The social [...] is seen to be performed by material things just as much as by humans, so that labelling one thing a person and one a machine, one thing material and one thing not, is not given in the order of things but is itself a product of the ordering of people and things that make up the social in the first place." Society as contingent and not necessary. Actants is Latour's term to define non-human and human elements of networks.

5 "There can be no fundamental separation between humanity and materiality - [...] everything that we are and do arises out of the reflection upon ourselves given by the mirror image of the process by which we create and form and are created by this same process"(Miller 2005: 8)

7 When John Law remarks that what is social is never just social but is also 'simultaneously technical, architectural, textual and, natural' he goes on to argue that the 'division between such categories is itself a relational achievement rather than something given in the order of things'(Law. 1991: 166). It is in these terms [...] that questions concerning the relations between culture, economy and the social now need to be posed: not as a matter of enfolding culture within the economy or the social, or, on the contrary, of attributing to it the power to construct these, but as historically contingent divisions betweendifferent sectors of activity each of which is composed of the same heterogenous 'mangle of practices' and is situated on the same plane"
"The virtue of Foucauldian conceptions of the social is that of avoiding any false ontologisation of the social as a universal while simultaneously recognising the complex set of interacting forces that have gone into making up the social as a historically specific 'transactional reality' mediating the relations between [government and population]." Foucault 2004 relevant for the significance he accords to the analysis of historically specific and mutable 'transactional realities' in place of universals

8 "the state is not founded fully formed but is a process of continual 'improvisation'"

9 agency is always relational

10 "infrastructure is a good is a good location for understanding how material powers can to varying extents operate outside human consciousness and language: indeed their power lies in this very muteness, this capacity to be left to operate by themselves"

13How do material things and processes, in concert with the human, assemble or format the state or bureaucratic systems. E.g. roads!

14 I wonder here how we could visualise the same process of 'unintended' formation looking at the impact of conservation bureaucracies on the effective preservation output (or informal learning patterns and decision-making). "Material powers are so often based on a bedrock of quotidian technologies". We are talking here of a low-tech technocrat --> low modernism?
