subvoce Geodetic Surveying in Australia: 484 (by John Manning)
Australian Height Datum adopted in 1971. First Australian vertical reference datum: mean sea level at thirty tide gauges along the coast

Subvoce Geodetic Surveying in Canada and the United States: 467 (by John D. Bossler and Michael C. Pinch)
Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1928 (CGVD28) remained in use when the US introduced the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, although work was under way to implement a new height reference system based on geoid modeling, better suited to current Canadian needs and conditions.

  The Canadian Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1928 (CGVD28) is the former vertical datum for Canada. It was adopted by an Order in Council in 1935. CGVD28 is a tidal datum defined by the mean water level at five tide gauges: Yarmouth and Halifax on the Atlantic Ocean, Pointe-au-Père on the St-Lawrence River, and Vancouver and Prince-Rupert on the Pacific Ocean. In addition, the definition includes an elevation at a benchmark in Rouses Point, NY (next to Lake Champlain) accepted as fixed by the United States and Canada in 1925. The datum is propagated in land using geodetic levelling measurements. The vertical datum is accessible through some 94,000 benchmarks anchored to the ground and stable structures. The heights in terms of CGVD28 are normal-orthometric system (Hno).

  North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88)
  The North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) is the vertical datum for the USA. It was affirmed as the official vertical datum in the National Spatial Reference System (NSRS) for the Conterminous United States and Alaska in 1993. NAVD 88 is a tidal datum defined by the mean water level at the tide gauge in Rimouski, Québec. The datum is propagated in land using geodetic levelling measurements. The vertical datum is accessible through benchmarks anchored to the ground and stable structures. The heights in terms of NAVD 88 are Helmert orthometric (HH). Canada did not adopt NAVD 88; however, NAVD 88 heights are available on a subset of the Canadian levelling network.

Subvoce Tidal Measurement by Philip L. Woodworth 1525-1528
Many measurements in the eighteenth century in Europe took the form of observations of the heights and times of high waters (Woodworth 1999, Woeppelmann 2008)
However the measurements were made, high waters were of gretaer importance for dock operations than low waters, and the former were easier to acquire.
First self registering tide gauge of the US made by Joseph Saxton for the US Coast Survey in 1851
PSMSL dates back to 1933
Ordnance Datum Newlyn registered from May 1915 to April 1921
