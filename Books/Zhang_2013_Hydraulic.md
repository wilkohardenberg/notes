**PartOne: ****The development of agricultural hydraulicengineering in ancient China**

 

**Chapter 1.** At first, here describes the importance ofwater conservancy construction generally. Two examples were presented: Du JiangYan(都江堰) project and Zheng Guo Qu（鄭國渠） project, from the aspects of purpose of construction,process and technology. *Yu Gong* *《禹貢》*chapter in *Shang Shu **《尚書》* wasthe oldest writing about Chinese hydraulic engineering.

**Chapter****2. **Hereintroduces the water conservancy construction from period of three kingdoms toTang dynasty, which is the stage of development and maturity of thistechnology. First of all, here compares the difference between north and south farmlandwater conservancy, and exemplifies the typical water conservancy project TaShan Yan(它山堰)， which was awater diversion irrigation project located in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province. Thischapter also introduces the establishment and improvement of water managementinstitutions, central and local organizations and water conservancy policy.

**Chapter 3. **This chapter introduces hydraulicengineering in Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties. During the Ming and Qingdynasties, farmland water conservancy system was popularized and developed,especially in Jiang Han area (江漢地區)。 Lots ofworks on agricultural water conservancy were written. And exploration ofprofessional education in this area began.

**Chapter4. **This chapter is about characteristics anddeficiency of ancient agricultural hydraulic engineering. It expounds first thephilosophical theory of traditional agricultural water conservancy, includingthe theory of heaven and man（天人合一）, and the theory of yin and yang.Then it briefly describes the lack of ancient water systems.



**Part Two: Development of agricultural waterconservancy project in early modern period China**

** **

**Chapter 5. **This chapter is about origin and developmentof agricultural water conservancy project in early modern period. First, itintroduces the introduction of western technology, such as measurement technology;the second important influence was new materials (cement and steel). In thischapter, you’ll also find contents about modern management of hydraulicsystems, and training of technology talents. Scientific researches were beenpaid attention too. Finally, this chapter introduces the development offarmland water system during the war of resistance against japan and the civilwar.

**Chapter 6. **This chapter introduces the construction ofagricultural water conservancy project after the founding of the people’srepublic of China. It demonstrates in five different time periods (see originaltext).

**Chapter 7. **This chapter introduces the construction andmanagement of farmland water systems after the reform and opening up in 1978 (改革開放). It wasdivided into three time periods (see original text). The tax reform on theperformance of water conservancy projects was also mentioned here.

**Chapter 8. **This chapter mainly introduces theachievements of hydraulic projects since the founding of the people’s republicof China (1949). Firstly, the achievements of irrigation engineering andirrigation technology research were introduced. Achievements of professionaleducation and training were mentioned too. Modern agricultural water-savingsystem has been a significant impact on hydraulic engineering. Finally,specific cases were exemplified, such as the people’s victory canal(人民勝利渠)，Hong Qicanal (紅旗渠)，south-northwater diversion project(南水北調) etc..

 

**Part Three: Ecological civilizationconstruction of agricultural hydraulic project**

** **

**Chapter 9. **This chapter introduces the background andcourse of the ecological civilization in the early 20th century inChina. Firstly, this chapter introduces the time and content of theinternational and domestic ecological civilization, and distinguishes theprimitive civilization, agricultural civilization and industrial civilization.Secondly, the chapter explains the semantic meaning of ecology andcivilization. Finally, it introduces the structure and characteristics ofecological civilization as well as its realization ways in China: civilizationof production activities, civilization of life style and civilization ofbuilding community.

**Chapter 10. **This chapter introduces water ecological civilization.First of all, the problems faced by China’s aquatic ecology were discussed; thoseproblems are water pollution, soil infiltration of soil erosion, unsafedrinking water, desertification and so on. Then here introduces theconstruction and development of aquatic ecological civilization, and takesBeijing and Shan Dong province as examples to outline the construction processof modern water ecological civilization.

**Chapter 11. **Construction of** **agricultural water conservancy ecological civilization. First ofall, here analyses why should pay attention to agricultural water conservancysystem, from the ecological point of view. And then it elaborates fourrelations that should be cooperated: relation between water resources andpopulation, relation between water resource development and ecologicalenvironment protection, relation between professional management and socialmanagement, relation between rural ecological construction and improvement ofpeople’s livelihood. Finally, the maintenance principles and systemconstruction of agricultural water ecological civilization are introduced.

**Chapter 12. **Here introduces practice of agriculturalecological civilization. Firstly, it introduces the Anshun Baotun (安順鮑屯)ancientagricultural water conservancy project in Gui Zhou province. And then itintroduces the national water-saving pilot city of Zhangye City（張掖市）.  Finally, the ecology and hydraulicconstructions in Gan Su and Shan Xi provinces were mentioned.

**Chapter 13. **This chapter holds prospects of agriculturalwater conservancy ecological civilization construction. First of all the trendof hydraulic research is introduced. And the existing problems and researchplans are analyzed. Then it introduces the development trend of agriculturalengineering construction and ecological civilization research. Finally, thedevelopment of interdisciplinary construction of those programs was brieflypresented.
