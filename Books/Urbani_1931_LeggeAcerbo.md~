title: Legge Acerbo
year: 1931
---

The subject of hunting was formerly regulated in Italy by the legilsative measures of the former states, up to the passage of the fascist law of the 24th of June 1923, No. 1420, which abrogated all the laws and decrees then in force, leaving in effect only those affecting the New Provinces.

Regulation, approved by Royal decree of September 24, 1923, No. 2448 for the execution of said laws

"a person breaking the regulations contained therein, could commit no more than a violation [contravvenzione]" because no mention is made of crimes [delitti]
Harshened by Legge Acerbo, which introduced offenses

"The penalties decreed for offenses under the Acerbo Law evidently cannot be punished except by arrest, imprisonment and fine (art. 11, Penal Code) while for violations there can be arrest, penalty and confiscation of the hunting or fowling license (suspension of hunting privileges)."

"The intent to break the law, that is, fraud, is necessary to constitute an offense but is not necessary for a violation. For the latter, it is sufficient to establish the material fact. Likewise no attention should be paid to any excuse of good faith or of ignorance of the law, as such is never admitted."

"Property rights held in a property do not authorize hunting on that property or the exclusion therefrom of every other hunter."

"The exclusive right of hunting, that is the right of hunting over a property, to the exclusion of others, arises legally when I have obtained a reserve license over that property."

res nullius
recognition of hunting right is a governmental prerogative
reserve is independent from ownership

"A preserve [bandita] is an area in which no one may hunt, not even the one who is the concessionaire thereof (that is, the one who holds title to the concession). A reserve \[riserva\], on the other hand, is an area in which only the concessionaire and persons authorized by him may hunt."

"It should be noticed, however that in a _bandita_, one may, or rather should, hunt obnoxious animals, not only on account of the damage they cause to crops but also because they cause the disappearance of useful game, both resident and migratory"

"Whoever wishes to hunt or capture protected species or for which there exist special prohibitions should submit application on 5 lire stamped paper to the proper Minister, preferably through the hands of the Provincial Hunting Commission, which will append its own reccomendation at the foot of the application. To the application there should be attached a sheet of 7 lire stamped paper."

Article 12: "In the Alpine zone the hunting season opens September 8 and closes December 15"
