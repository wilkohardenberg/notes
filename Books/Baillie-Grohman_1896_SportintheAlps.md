265 the combination of Zumstein's and VEII efforts "effectually rescued the ibex from sharing the fate of the dodo or of Steller's sea-cow."
55 keepers "so ggod was their makrsmanship that the officers of the law had but few opportunities to inflict the nine years' imprisonment, which was, and for all I know to the contrary, still is the punishment for killing one of the king's bouquetins?"

150 to 200 beaters, "all picked mnountaineers from Aosta and Cogne, circumvented the game by great detorus, and finally forced it to pass certain well-known defiles, where the sportsmen lay in ambush behind screens of loosely heaped up stones" always at altitudes of over 10,000 feet to hunt only old males. Height difference made it easier to select which gender to hunt.

274 "Be that as it may, sportsmen and naturalists owe a great debt to this royal chasseur. In the mountains over which he was master he was worshipped, his plain-spoken simple ways, his coarse home-spun shooting-dress, his unassuming bonhomie won him the love of his people to a degree not usually vouchsafed  to royalty. Nothing pleased him more than to wander about incognito, chatting with every peasant he met, and some amusing stories were told of his adventures. Once, a peasant, seeing what he supposed to be one of the numerous staff of keepers, addressed to him a request to shoot a fox which was constantly raiding his hen-coop."

"The present King of Italy has, I believe, only shot in his ibex preserves two or three times since his accession eighteen years ago."

275 citation from _Il Diritto_ 14 Aug 1894:
"The king's headquarters for these ibex hunts is still the Campo del Re (the King's Camp), which is situated at a height of about 6600 feet, in the heart of the shooting, and is reached by means of an easy mule track, 6 feet wide, from the small town of Noasca, on the banks of the Orco, a tributary of the Po.
This track like all others in these mountains, was made by Victor Emanuel. As the difference in altitude between Noasca and Campo del Re is 3500 feet, the path zig-zags up the steep slopes in comparatively gentle gradients." mcontinues with description of the Campo"
276 continues "The driving is done by some 300 beaters, all picked men, from the neighbouring valleys, who receive the princely pay of 10 frs per day each. The runs or passes whihc the ibex take in their flight are of course known, for the nature of the ground, and the frequency of sheer precipices upon which the surprisingly sure-footed ibex can find no foothold, forces it to take to the few existing passes in its gallant attempts to escape the ever-narrowing circle of beaters. The scene of the dirves is invariably at considerable altitudes, never less than 9000 feet, and as a rule over 10,000 feet; but of course the climbing is done by th beaters and keepers, and not by the guns."

"Of late years, probably in consequence of a slightly relaxed watch upon the doings of poachers on the part of the present king's keepers (a staff of forty five, is I believe, still kept up), genuine bouquetin headsa re no longer quite so rare, but they still fetch very high prices." highly valued trophies by collectors/
