proposal should already show off your qualities as an author/writer

need to convey an idea in a way that makes clear why it is interesting and the book will sell

avoid jargon

address your markets:

- say why people will buy the book, despite the fact that there are other books that talk about similar topics: where does it differ, what makes it unique

length proposal: not less than 2 single-spaced, no more than 4 single-spaced pages

In proposal: You are presenting the ark of the book, laying out the scope of the argument and its importance and positioning on the market

then, markets and audience

refer to how your book sides along existing books by the publisher / series

short para on status of the manuscript

100,000 words, including everything, is a good thing to aim for

Then chapter outline

- can be bullet list
- or can explain organization and give more detail
- preferred approach would be to give a paragraph for each chapter
  - make clear what additional work you have done in respect to diss

whole proposal about 10 pages single space

don't promise anything that you are not going to deliver

if you are able to get an advance payment the publisher will be more interested in market your book, they'll be more committed

the synopsis needs a narrative (story) and a hook! Readers need to be grabbed in
